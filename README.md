# AvoDocs
Community documentation for the Avolites Titan software

If you see a problem in the Titan manual, please create
a new **Issue** describing the problem. Avolites staff
will be along to fix it, or you can create a **Branch** for
your problem from the Master (call it "correction/#nnn" where n is your
Issue number) and edit the .md files in the /docs folder to
fix the problem. Then create a Pull Request to submit
your change suggestion.

If you are making edits, please see the [Titan Manual Style Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
to help keep the text style consistent.

To set up a local server so you can see your changes live, 
see the readme in the /website directory.
After you have made changes to the /docs directory you 
will be able to see them in the @next version of your local server.
You can visit this page by clicking on the version number 
in the header and selecting next.

See the issues on github for things that we want help with!

Don't worry about editing the current version files, this will 
be handled when we deploy a new version of the docs.
