# AvoDocs
Community documentation for the Avolites Titan software

You can contribute to the docs by editing the .md files in the /docs folder directly.

See the issues on github for things that we want help with!

For local running see the readme in the /website directory.

After you have made changes to the /docs directory you will be able to see them in the @next version.
You can visit this page by clicking on the version number in the header and selecting next.

Don't worry about editing the current version files, this will be handled when we deploy a new version of the docs.
