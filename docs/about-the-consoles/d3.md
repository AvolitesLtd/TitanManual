## D3-110

![D3-110](/docs/images/D3-110-front.png)

The D3-110 is a compact standalone console with a built in touchscreen and 10 playback faders.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>A</Keys.Annotation> The **Playback faders** and buttons are the main place to store and play back cues or chases
but can also be assigned a range of other functions.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>B</Keys.Annotation> The **Page Select buttons** let you change to a different page of
playbacks. The bottom of the screen shows information about each
playback.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>C</Keys.Annotation> The **Attribute Control wheels** are used to set control values
(attributes) for the fixtures, and also to set other parameters. The
bottom right corner of the screen shows information about the parameters and values the wheels are controlling.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>D</Keys.Annotation> The **Attribute select buttons** are used to select which attributes of
a fixture (e.g. colour, gobo, position) are going to be controlled using
the Control wheels. The buttons light up to show you which
attributes are active. 



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>E</Keys.Annotation> The **Playback control buttons** allow you to control cue lists and chases, and move about in the list.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>F</Keys.Annotation> The **Numeric keypad** and other control buttons are used to enter
values and change controls on the system.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>G</Keys.Annotation> The **Function buttons** are used to carry out functions such as recording
cues, copying, saving to disk, etc.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>H</Keys.Annotation> The **Workspace, Macros and Executer** buttons are programmable
buttons which can be used to store cues such as strobe cues, workspaces 
(screen layouts), or button macros.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>I</Keys.Annotation> The **Workspace Window buttons**, along with the <Keys.HardKey>View</Keys.HardKey> button at the top right of the numeric keypad, are used to set which windows are shown on the screen. The <Keys.HardKey>Latch</Keys.HardKey> button bottom right keeps the current menu active.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>J</Keys.Annotation> The **Menu Softkeys** (labelled A - G) are used to select control options. 
The right hand side of the display shows what each one will do - you can touch the softkey on-screen instead of using these
buttons. The options for each 
key change depending on what the console is doing. Softkey commands are shown 
in the manual like this: <Keys.SoftKey>Edit Times</Keys.SoftKey>.

At the bottom right of the console, the <Keys.HardKey>Locate</Keys.HardKey> button is used to light up and set selected fixtures to a zero position.


&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>K</Keys.Annotation> The **Fixture Select buttons** are used when programming to step through a range of selected fixtures, turn highlighting on or off, fan the values or select a pattern of fixtures.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>L</Keys.Annotation> The **Syntax Select buttons** are used to form syntax/keypad commands when you are programming.


![D3-110 back panel](/docs/images/D3-110-back.png)

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>M</Keys.Annotation> An external touch monitor can be connected to this DisplayPort socket. Only one external monitor can be connected.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>N</Keys.Annotation> USB sockets for backup drive, keyboard, mouse or D3 Wing.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>O</Keys.Annotation> EtherCON ports for Art-Net or sACN output, or other network connection.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>P</Keys.Annotation> Four optically isolated DMX outputs are provided on 5-pin XLR. Up to 24 universes can be controlled in total (the others on Art-Net or sACN via the network port).

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>Q</Keys.Annotation> Input for LTC timecode. A signal LED below the socket shows LTC activity.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>R</Keys.Annotation> Audio input for generating Audio Triggers.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>S</Keys.Annotation> Mains input and isolation switch.

## D3-010

![D3-010](/docs/images/D3-010-front.png)

The D3-010 is a compact standalone console with 10 playback faders, designed to operate with an external USB-C touchscreen.


&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>A</Keys.Annotation> The **Playback faders** and buttons are the main place to store and play back cues or chases
but can also be assigned a range of other functions.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>B</Keys.Annotation> The **Page Select buttons** let you change to a different page of

## D3-Core

![D3 Core](/docs/images/D3-core-front.png)

The D3 Core is a 1U rack mounted processor that runs Titan as a standalone controller. You can connect a T3 / T3 fader wing to provide controls, or the D3-Touch for simple touch screen installation, or a standard Windows Touch compatible touchscreen can show the full Titan Go interface. You can also control over Ethernet from other automation systems using Avolites WebAPI.

![D3 Core back](/docs/images/D3-core-back.png)

- Four optically isolated DMX outputs are provided on 5-pin XLR. Up to 16 universes can be controlled in total (the others on Art-Net or sACN via the network port).

- A touch monitor can be connected either to the USB-C socket on the front panel or the DisplayPort socket on the rear panel. Only one monitor can be connected.

- An input is provided for LTC timecode. A signal LED below the socket shows LTC activity.

- A 6.35mm jack socket is provided for GPIO triggering.


## D3 Touch

![D3 Touch](/docs/images/D3-touch-front.png)

The D3 Touch is an installation touchscreen giving simple, reliable access to a selection of playbacks on a Titan system. The touchscreen is connected and powered using Power-over-Ethernet. Any Titan system apart from T1 can be controlled by the D3 Touch panel.

See the [Remote Control](../remote-control.md) section for details of how to program the D3-Touch panel.

## D3 Wing

The D3 Wing adds 20 additional playback faders and 30
macro/executor buttons to the main console. It connects by a single USB
cable to the D3.

It is designed to fit next to the D3-110 or D3-010, but it can be
used with any of the Avolites Titan console range and also the T2 USB device. It has the same functionality as the T3 wing but with different styling to match the D3 range.

![D3 Wing](/docs/images/D3-wing.png)

If you want to see the legends and function information for the controls on the wing, there is a **Mobile Wing** workspace window - double click <Keys.HardKey>View</Keys.HardKey> and select "Mobile Wing". Using the Context Menu buttons you can select different views for this workspace which combine the playbacks and macro/executor buttons into one screen, or you can display them in separate
pages.
