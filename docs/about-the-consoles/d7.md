The Diamond 7 has the following main control areas. There are two models, the 
D7-330 with three touchscreens and 30 playback faders and the smaller D7-215 (illustrated) which has two touchscreens and
15 playback faders:

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>A</Keys.Annotation> The two main **Touch screens** (three on D7-330) contain the main workspace windows for the console. 
These contain a user-configurable
layout of touch buttons for fixtures, palettes, groups, playbacks, macros and more.
You can also show the integrated Capture visualiser, video feed monitors or a range
of information screens such as intensity levels or DMX output levels.
At the bottom of the right-hand screen, the current wheel assignments
are shown. At the bottom of
the left-hand screen(s), handle legends for the main faders and encoders are shown.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>B</Keys.Annotation> The **Playback faders** and **Rotary playback faders** select and control cues, cue lists and chases, and other configurable functions. (D7-330 has additional faders).

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>C</Keys.Annotation> The **Programming and setup controls** configure and program the console,
within which a smaller **Editor touchscreen** shows the fixture Attribute Editor (or can be switched to show macro legends), and 
the **macro/executor buttons** are playback buttons allowing storage of cues or
chases, frequent key sequences, screen layouts or groups. To the left of these
controls are the cue list playback controls.

The Diamond 7 has built in LED lighting above the screens to light the desk surface. There are also sockets for conventional gooseneck lamps
for scripts. The brightness is controlled from the wheels when in System Menu.

## Playback section

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>D</Keys.Annotation> The motorised **Playback faders** and associated buttons are the main place to store and play back cues or chases
but can also be assigned a range of other functions. Each fader has LED halo lighting
which represents the active state of the playback in a user-configurable colour.
The touch screen above the faders shows information about
each playback.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>E</Keys.Annotation> The **Page Select buttons** at the
left side of the faders let you change to a different page.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>F</Keys.Annotation> The **Rotary Faders** and associated buttons  can be used to store
a range of program functions including cues, chases, and fixture groups.
The rotary faders have LED halo lighting around them
which represents the active state of the playback in a user-configurable colour.
The touch screen above the faders shows legends indicating their function.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>G</Keys.Annotation> The **Playback controls** are used to control the playback of cue
lists and include a motorised fader pair in the Sequence Control Section to control the 
connected playback/master.

## Programming section

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>H</Keys.Annotation> The five  **Control wheels** are used to set control values (attributes) for
the fixtures, and to set chase speeds and fades. The touch screen above
the wheels shows information about the attributes being controlled. The buttons
to the right of the wheels switch them to other functions such as fade timing,
shape control or visualiser control.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>I</Keys.Annotation> The **Numeric keypad** and other control buttons are used to enter
values and change controls on the console.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>J</Keys.Annotation> The **Attribute Buttons** are used to select which attributes of
a fixture (e.g. colour, gobo, pan, focus) are going to be controlled
using the Control wheels. The buttons light up to show you which
attributes are active.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>K</Keys.Annotation> The **Editor Touchscreen** shows the Attribute Editor
window giving a different way to select attributes such as colours and gobos. This screen can be switched to show legends for the
10 macro buttons below along with 10 playback buttons, using the Screen Mode button top right of the screen.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>L</Keys.Annotation> The **Function buttons** are used to carry out functions such as storing
cues, copying, patching, saving to disk, etc.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>M</Keys.Annotation> The dedicated **Intensity Wheel** controls intensity
of selected fixtures. The intensity setting is shown in the bottom right corner of the right-hand touchscreen.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>N</Keys.Annotation> The **Macro Buttons** store playbacks or frequently used sequences of keypresses
which can be replayed with a single button press. The display immediately above the buttons shows legends for
the buttons. 

## Front edge of the console
