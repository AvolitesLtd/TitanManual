T1 and T2 are USB dongles which plug into a Windows PC or laptop. See [minimum PC specifications](../titan-basics.md#connecting-up-t3--titan-mobile-and-t1t2) for details of the PC requirements. Both dongles include an AvoKey.

**T1** provides a single universe of DMX output on a 5-pin XLR. USB-MIDI devices are not supported.

**T2** provides two universes on two 5-pin XLRs and has an input for
Audio/LTC timecode for external triggering. It also enables the use of a USB MIDI device for MIDI
triggering of Titan, which for example would allow you to use a MIDI fader surface, and also allows use of
the T3 or Titan mobile fader wing.

The older Titan One dongle (now discontinued) also provided a single universe of DMX output on a 5-pin XLR. USB-MIDI devices are not supported.

> This version of the Titan One dongle with the fixed USB cable does not include an 
  AvoKey; a separate AvoKey must be purchased and attached to another USB port on your
  computer to allow use of Titan v12 and later.

## Installing the Titan software

Install the Titan PC Suite software on your PC (see [Connecting up T3/Titan Mobile and T1/T2](../titan-basics.md#connecting-up-t3--titan-mobile-and-t1t2)) before
you plug in the USB, to make sure the correct drivers are installed. The link also lists some Windows settings you should check to avoid interruptions to your show.



The T1 and T2 devices use the Titan Go application. All functions are identical
to the Titan software used on consoles, but the operating screen layout is slightly different to a console
display as it provides virtual touch buttons and faders to replace the physical controls on the consoles.
