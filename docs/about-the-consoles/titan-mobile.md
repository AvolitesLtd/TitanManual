being controlled.

a fixture (e.g. colour, gobo, position) are going to be controlled using

key change depending on what the console is doing. Softkey commands are shown 
in the manual like this: <Keys.SoftKey>Edit Times</Keys.SoftKey>

with a mouse.

## Titan Mobile Connections panel

![Titan Mobile Connections](/docs/images/Titan-Mobile-Connections.png)
All the connections required for the
control panel are found on the right hand side. Most are
self-explanatory. 



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>Q</Keys.Annotation> Four DMX outputs are provided on XLR, and a MIDI input.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>R</Keys.Annotation> USB to host computer. The current version of the Titan Mobile panel has only
one USB socket rather than the original 2 shown in the picture above.
Normally the panel is powered via the USB connection. Some laptop
    USB ports may not provide sufficient power for the panel, in which
    case the DC power input &nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>S</Keys.Annotation> can be used to connect an external 9V DC
    power supply, available from Avolites.



&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>T</Keys.Annotation> The PE socket / stud is to allow you to ground/earth the panel, which can
    help resolve DMX problems if your laptop is not earthed.
