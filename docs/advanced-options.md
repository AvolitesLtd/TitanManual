Fading shape size and speed
---------------------------

When a shape is stored in a cue, you can set how the shape fades in
using the Edit Times and the Playback Option settings.

To set the shape size and/or speed from the fader position, press
\[Playback Options\] from the main menu then press the select button of
the playback.

Using the \[Fader\] \[Shape Size\] and \[Shape Speed\] buttons you can
set the shape size and speed to be fixed (how you programmed them) or to
grow larger/speed up as the fader is pushed up. You can also allocate a
Speed or Size Master to control the speed or size, see section 13.1.4 on
page 280..

  ![tip](/docs/images/image7.png)   When you use dimmer shapes, set the playback to \[Shape Size on Fader\] so that the shape fades in as you push up the fader. Otherwise the dimmer shape will snap in at full brightness when the fader passes the trigger point. From Titan v9 this is the default setting.

To set a fixed fade in time for the shape size, press \[Edit Times\]
from the top menu, then the playback select button, then set the
Delay/Fade times you want.

The Fade Mode allows you to set mode 0 (fade in), mode 1 (fade in and
out) or mode 3 (crossfade). Mode 2 links fade times to the fader
position, however we recommend you use the Playback Options listed above
to do this for shapes, and do not use Mode 2.

If a new cue is fired which controls the same attributes (for example, a
second shape controlling the same fixtures as a currently running
shape), the new shape will crossfade from the running shape.
