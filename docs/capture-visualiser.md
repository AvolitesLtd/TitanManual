The Capture visualiser engine is integrated into the Titan consoles.
This can provide a realistic simulation of your lighting which is really
useful for pre-programming or making changes in blind mode during a
show.

This chapter also has a section on [linking the console to an external
full version of Capture](capture-visualiser/linking-the-console-to-stand-alone-capture.md)
which can be useful if you need to visualise a set or a full venue, as the internal
Capture engine has limited modelling facilities.

To open the visualiser, select <Keys.SoftKey>Capture Visualiser</Keys.SoftKey> from the <Keys.SoftKey>Open
Workspace Window</Keys.SoftKey> menu (see [Open Workspace Window](titan-basics/workspace-windows.md#shortcuts-to-open-workspace-windows)).

> Always **pre-program using palettes**, because things never quite line up the same in a visualiser as they do in the real world. Using palettes means that you just need to reprogram a few palettes when you get onto the real rig, rather than having to change lots of cues separately.
