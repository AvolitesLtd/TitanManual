The Capture visualiser engine is integrated into the Titan consoles.
This can provide a realistic simulation of your lighting which is really
useful for pre-programming or making changes in blind mode during a
show.

This chapter also has a section on [linking the console to an external
full version of Capture](capture-visualiser/linking-the-console-to-stand-alone-capture.md)
which can be useful if you need to visualise a set or a full venue, as the internal
Capture engine has limited modelling facilities.

To open the visualiser, select \[Capture Visualiser\] from the [\[Open
Workspace Window\] menu](titan-basics/workspace-windows.md#shortcuts-to-open-workspace-windows).

> Always **pre-program using palettes**, because things never quite line up the same in a visualiser as they do in the real world. Using palettes means that you just need to reprogram the palettes when you get onto the real rig, rather than having to change lots of cues separately.
