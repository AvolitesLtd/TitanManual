Most of the options are the same as for Cues (see section 8.6 on page
216), only the additional Chase options are described here.

Chase options -- Playback tab
-----------------------------

Blind, Priority, Shape Behaviour are described in the Cues chapter.

**Loop Action:** Sets what happens at the end of the chase.\
\[Stop on Final Cue\] -- chase stops at the end\
\[Loop\] - the chase will loop back to the beginning

**Play Order:** sets the direction of the chase.

**Linking:** Sets how the cues in the chase are linked. The options
are:\
\[Link according to individual steps\] - Each step in the chase will
obey its individual link settings which are set using the Playback View
window or the \<Unfold\> function.\
\[Always Link Steps\] - The chase will run on its own using the times\
\[Never Link Steps\] - The chase will pause after every delay/fade time
for the user to press Go.

  ![tip](/docs/images/image7.png){width="0.7361111111111112in" height="0.6527777777777778in"}   When a chase is unlinked, raising the fader does not fire the first cue, which can be a problem. To get round this, if the chase is not looped, simply link the first cue to the previous one. If the chase is looped, add a dummy step at the end with 0 sec fade, 0 sec delay and link the first step to this one.

**XFade:** Provides another way of setting chase crossfade.

Chase options -- Handle tab
---------------------------

All options in this section are described in the cues chapter.

Chase Options -- Effects tab
----------------------------

All options in this section are described in the cues chapter.

Chase Options -- Release tab
----------------------------

Release Mask and Release Time are described in the cues chapter.

**Cue Release:** allows you to create an overlay chase with gaps in it
where the fixtures will return to their previous state. For example you
could create a chase where every alternate cue sets the fixtures to
white, with the in between cues being blank. If this option is on, the
fixtures will bump to white then return to the colour set from a
previous look.

Renumber All Cues
-----------------

This option is only available on the softkeys, not the option screen.
This will renumber all the cues in the chase starting from 1.
