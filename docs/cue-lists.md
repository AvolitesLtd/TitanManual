Cue Lists (sometimes known as stacks or cue stacks) allow you to record
a sequence of cues, each of which can have its own timings and can be
triggered by the Go button or run automatically to the next cue. This
allows you to build a complete show in a single list and is ideal for
theatrical shows where the show must be exactly the same each time. Cue
lists can also be useful in busked shows, especially on consoles with a
small number of playback faders, to offer a number of different looks on
one fader.

Cue lists differ from chases in the way the console handles changes
between cues. Cue lists track fixture state from previous cues and will
only change the fixture state if you have modified that fixture in the
cue; if there are no changes stored for the fixture, it will remain in
the same state. Chases on the other hand would crossfade between cues,
fading out all fixtures which have no stored information in the new cue.

You can change the tracking behaviour of cue lists using the tracking
option for each cue: Block, This Cue Only and Solo (see section Tracking
on page 239).

To view the contents of a cue list, touch the playback screen relating
to the fader or press \<Open/View\> then the swop button of the
playback.
