the additional Cue List options are described here.

--- 

## Handle Tab

All options are the same as for a cue, see [Options](../cues/playback-options.md#handle-tab).

--- 

## Playback Tab

Blind, Cross Fade HTP, Priority, Run On Startup are the same as for a cue and described in [Playback](../cues/playback-options.md#playback-tab).

Setting | Action
--- | ---
Stop on final cue | Cue list will stop advancing once it reaches the last cue.
Loop | Cue list will go back to first cue after the last.* If Move in Dark is enabled, this will also loop.*  *(default)*

### Move In Dark
Sets the mode for the whole cue list *(see [Move In Dark (MID) Functions](cue-list-playback.md#move-in-dark-mid-functions))*.

Setting | Action
--- | ---
Off | Obeys settings for individual cues *(default option)*
Disabled | No move in dark even if set in cues
Early | Moves as soon as fixture intensity is 0
Late | Moves in the last cue before the fixture is needed

### Shape Tracking
Sets how shapes are tracked between cues.
Setting | Action
--- | ---
Off | Shapes will stop when the next cue starts
On | Shapes will track until stopped or changed in a cue
Local | Follows the tracking option above *(default option)*

### Timecode Source

## Times Tab

All options are the same as for cues, see [Times](../cues/playback-options.md#times-tab).

--- 

## Fader Tab

### Cue List Fader Mode
Sets how the cue list fader behaves.

Setting | Action
--- | ---
Fader Mode Intensity Kill With Off | The fader masters the overall HTP level and the cue list remains active (connected) even when the fader is lowered to zero.
Fader Mode Intensity Kill At 0 | The fader masters the overall HTP level and the cue list is killed when the fader is lowered to zero.
Manual Crossfader | The fader behaves as a manual crossfade control, and the cue list will automatically step on to the next cue when the fader begins travel from top or bottom.

When the fader is in **Manual Crossfader** mode:
- A running fade can be "captured" onto the fader for manual control by matching the fader position.
- When firing a cue list in manual crossfade the intensity snaps to full when the fader leaves zero.
- [Shapes](../effects/shape-generator.md) and [Pixel Mapper](../effects/pixel-mapper.md) effects will fade in with the manual crossfade, but when the fader returns to 0 they are not removed so may still affect the output.
- [Autoloads](../cue-lists/creating-a-cue-list.md#autoloading-a-playback-within-a-cue-list) in the cue list will use their programmed fade times, regardless of the manual crossfade performed by the fader.
- Partially completed crossfades can be completed by pressing \<Go\>.

### Fire First Cue
Sets whether the first cue automatically fires when
the fader is raised, or if you need to press the \<Go\> button to fire it.

--- 

## Effects Tab

All options are the same as for cues, see [Effects](../cues/playback-options.md#effects-tab).

--- 

## Release Tab

Release Mask and Release Time are described for cues, see [Release](../cues/playback-options.md#release-tab).

### Cue Release
Sets fixtures to release when moving to the next cue, if they are
not programmed in the next cue. This can be useful for creating
some effects.

> The **Cue Options** which could be set here in previous versions are now set using the Playback View window,
