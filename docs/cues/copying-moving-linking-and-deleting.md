Copying or moving a cue
-----------------------

Using the \<Copy\> button you can make a copy of an existing cue, move
it to a new playback, or create a new playback which is linked to the
existing playback. You can copy, move or link multiple playbacks (which
may be cues, chases or cue lists) in one operation.

Move is useful for tidying up the console. Linked cues are handy if you
want a cue to appear on more than one page for ease of operation; also
the linked cue can have different timings and playback options from the
cue it's linked to.

1. Press \<Copy\>.

2. Select \[Copy\], \[Move\] or \[Link\]. Pressing \<Copy\> again will
also toggle these options. Some consoles have a \<Move\> button to get
straight into Move mode.

3. Press the select button of the cue you want to copy/move/link. You
can select a range of playbacks by holding the first button while
pressing the last in the range, or use the \<Thro\> and \<And\> buttons
to add more playbacks to the selection -- hold down \<And\> to keep
adding them.

4. Press the empty select button where you want it to go.

-   The \<Menu Latch\> button latches the Copy/Move/Link menu, so you
    can keep copying, moving or linking things without having to keep
    pressing the button. The latched menu will stay active until you
    press \<Menu Latch\> to unlatch it.

-   \[Retain Layout\] or \[Bunch Up\] is used when copying a group of
    cues with empty playbacks in the group -- you can either keep the
    empty playbacks, or bunch up the used playbacks together.

-   When in Copy mode, option \[Copy Legends\] can be changed to \[Don't
    copy legends\] so that the copied cues are given default legends.

-   When in Move mode, \[Swap Items if Required\] will attempt to
    reposition any existing playbacks which are in the way of the move.
    This is useful when rearranging playbacks on a page which is nearly
    full.

Deleting a cue
--------------

To delete a cue:

1. Press the \<Delete\> button.

2. Press the select button of the cue you want to delete.

3. Press the select button again (or press \<Enter\>) to confirm the
delete.

-   Instead of deleting the cue you can select \[Unassign\], this will
    remove the cue from the handle but retain it for future use. Go to
    the Show Library to reuse unassigned cues.

-   Press \<Menu Latch\> to keep the delete mode active. You can keep
    deleting using steps 2 and 3 without having to keep pressing the
    Delete button. Press \<Menu Latch\> to leave latched delete mode.
