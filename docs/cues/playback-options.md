To set options for a cue, chase or cue list, press \<Options\> (or the \[Options\] softkey
on the top level menu), then press the **Select** button of the playback to be
edited. The Options window will open allowing you to set a wide range
of options for how the playback will work, including Times. (You can also set the options using the softkeys.)

You can also [set Times for the playback](cue-timing.md), using the \<Time\> button or the \[Times\] softkey rather than Options.

The options are split into different categories using tabs down the left hand side.
Click on the \[i\] button for a help window on each setting.
The options shown below in the pictures are for a normal cue, for cue lists and chases the options are different (and are described
in the Cue List chapter and the Chases chapter).


> You can select multiple playbacks if you want to set the options the
same on all of them. If the current option settings are the same on all selected playbacks,
then the display shows the current option selected; otherwise a star is shown next to the options
and no option is shown selected.

## Handle Tab

![Playback Options window for cue showing handle tab](/docs/images/Playback-Options-Handle-Tab.png)

### Handle Paging
Allows you to lock the playback on a handle so that
it always appears on that handle no matter what page is selected. This
is useful if you have some general playbacks you want on every page,
without having to copy the playback onto each page.

Setting | Action
------: | ------
Unlocked | This playback will change with the pages as normal
Transparent Lock | This playback will appear on all pages where the handle is unprogrammed
Locked | This playback will appear on all pages. Playbacks programmed on this handle on other pages will not be accessible.

### Key Profile
Sets the [key profile](../system-settings/key-profiles.md) individually for this playback.
Global sets the back to the global default setting for playbacks. A shortcut to change
the key profile for a playback is to hold the \<Options\> button down while pressing the handle select.

## Playback Tab

![Playback Options showing playback tab](/docs/images/Playback-Options-Chase-Playback-Tab.png)

### Blind
Sets this individual playback to **Blind** mode. The playback
will then output only to Visualiser, not to the stage. This can be very
useful if you need to program and test a cue during a live show.

### Cross Fade HTP
If on, makes the HTP (dimmer) channels in this cue
override other HTP channels, obeying the [priority](#priority) settings. Normally if
a dimmer channel was up in another cue, the highest dimmer setting would
continue to be output, but this option lets you create a playback that
will override this behaviour, so if you specifically need some fixtures
to be at 50%, this option will let you do that.

### Priority
Allows you to configure how playbacks will behave if you
turn on two playbacks controlling the same fixture. The priority can be
set to **Low**, **Normal**, **High**, **Programmer** or **Very High** (*Programmer* gives the
same level as manually set attributes in the programmer). If a fixture
is being controlled by a playback and you turn on a playback of the same
or higher priority, then the new playback will take over. However, if
the new playback is set to lower priority than the first playback, the
fixture will not change.

This is useful if, for example, you've programmed looks using all your
fixtures, then you decide you want a couple of them to spotlight a
singer. If you set the spotlight playback to be high priority, then
while it is active no other playback will affect the spotlight fixtures.

> Priority is useful when using **Swop** buttons for strobe-type effects
where you want to black out everything else. If you have a position
shape running on other fixtures, you don't want that to stop during the
Swop, or it will look messy when you release the Swop button. So set the
shape playback to have a higher priority than the strobe playback, and
it will keep going during the strobe and continue smoothly when you
release the Swop button.

Attributes set by manually applying a palette to a fixture will
override all playback priorities except Very High.

### Run On Startup
Sets this playback to run when the console powers
on. This can be globally disabled by the
[Run Startup Playbacks](../system-settings/user-settings.md#run-startup-playbacks) option in
[User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md) *(turned on by default)*.

This can be very useful for unattended applications to set up an
initial lighting state.

Power on playbacks show a Power symbol watermark in the playback
information area above the fader. If you open the
[Show Library window](../titan-basics/show-library.md)
there is a context button to Show Startup
Playbacks which allows you to list all the playbacks which are set to
run on startup.

## Times tab

![Playback Options showing times tab](/docs/images/Playback-Options-Times-Tab.png)

### Delay In / Fade In / Fade Out
Sets the delay time before fade, and the fade in and fade out times for the playback.
These times can also be set using the \<TIME\> button.

### Fixture Overlap
Fixture overlap creates an effect where the fixtures in the cue are changed in
sequence rather than all at the same time. This is described in more detail in
[Cue Timing](cue-timing.md#fade-times-and-fixture-overlap).

### Flash Fade In / Flash Fade Out
Sets the fade in/fade out time for
this playback when it is fired using the flash button. By default these
are set to *"As In"* and *"As Out"* which will use the fade time set for the
playback in the [Times menu](cue-timing.md). This option allows you to set a different
flash action for the playback. *Note that the [Key Profile](../system-settings/key-profiles.md) for the flash
button must be set to **Timed Flash** for this to work.*

### Speed
Default speed for shapes/effects in this playback in BPM. This can be
overridden by a [Rate or BPM master](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#speed-and-size-masters).

## Fader Tab

![Playback Options showing fader tab](/docs/images/Playback-Options-Fader-Tab.png)

### Cue Fader Mode
Sets how the fader position affects the cue output.

Setting | Action
------: | ------
Mode 0 | Channels fade in as set by the fade time. The Fade Out time is ignored. If times are set to zero, the HTP channels fade in with the 0-100% position of the playback fader and the LTP channels will snap.
Mode 1 | HTP channels fade in and out as set by the fade out times (LTP channels fade in but then remain as set in the cue). If times are set to zero, the HTP levels will fade in and out with the fader and the LTP channels will snap when the cue is fired.
Mode 2 | Both HTP and LTP channels follow the fader position. *Useful when used with a pan/tilt cue for manually tracking a spot across a stage or down a catwalk using the fader position or for mixing colours on RGB fixtures.*
Mode 3 | Crossfade cue. All channels, including intensity channels, will fade to the settings in the new cue. All other cues fade out and all other active playbacks become inactive; if you need to re-fire a playback, take the fader to zero and put it up again. *Useful for setting a video playback state.*

This is the same option as set in the [\[Edit Times\]
menu](cue-timing.md).

### Curve
Allows you to set a different curve shape for this playback - curves
are listed on the softkeys. The various curves are illustrated
in the [Curves](../system-settings/curves.md) section.

## Effects Tab

![Playback Options showing effects tab](/docs/images/Playback-Options-Effects-Tab.png)

### Effect Speed Multiplier
Lets you modify the speed of the effects programmed into this playback.

### Shape & Effect Speed
Sets whether the fader position modifies the speed of shapes in this playback. If set to \[On Fader\] then the speed will change from 0 with the fader at 0, up to the programmed
speed with the fader at full. You can use the multiplier option above to get faster speeds than the programmed speed.

> If you have a cue which contains only shapes to overlay on other cues, set the cue to \[Size on Fader\] and allocate a [Speed Master](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#speed-and-size-masters). You can then create lots of different looks out of the shape by varying the size and speed at show time using the playback fader and the speed master.

### Shape Behaviour
Controls the behaviour of Key Frame Shapes in this playback:

Setting | Action
------: | ------
Global | Use global setting from [User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md#shape-behaviour)
Overlay | Shape continues to run over changes to attributes
LTP | If attributes are changed, the shape will stop running on those attributes

### Shape Size
Sets whether the fader position modifies the size of shapes in this
playback

Setting | Action
------: | ------
Fixed | No effect
Fader | Size of all types of shape set by fader position (from 0 up to the programmed size)
HTP Fader | Only dimmer shapes are controlled by fader position

### Size Source
Allows you to allocate a
[Size Master](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#speed-and-size-masters)
to control the size of shapes running in this playback.

### Speed Source
Allows you to allocate a
[Speed Master](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#speed-and-size-masters)
to control the size of shapes running in this playback.

## Release Tab

![Playback Options showing release tab](/docs/images/Playback-Options-Release-Tab.png)

### Release Mask
Lets you specify which attributes will be released to
the state they were in previously when this
playback is killed (you lower the fader to zero). 

Normally using the LTP rules, attributes will stay in their last state when
you kill a playback. This is not always what you want (for example with a strobe
cue, you don't want the strobing to carry on when you kill the cue).

Click the button to toggle the mask to Local, then select which
attribute types you want to release
You can also use the
Attribute Bank buttons to set the mask.

Global release uses the global
release mask which is set in the **Release menu** (press \<Release\>).

> Release mask is useful when creating a temporary strobe
effect on a playback. Set **Mask** to **Local** then **Intensity** to **Include**. Now when you turn off
the playback the shutter channel will release to its previous state
and the strobe will stop.

You can also use [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md) to
allocate one of the handle buttons to release the playback.

### Release Time
Sets a release fade time for this playback. Enter a
blank time to return to global *([Global release time](../system-settings/user-settings.md#master-release-time) is set in the [User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md))*.
