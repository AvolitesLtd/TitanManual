The console provides a variety of curves which set how the console
tracks fades in playbacks; either the same speed all the way (linear),
or starting and ending gently but faster in the middle, and various
other options. Curves are used in various places in the console, one
example is in the \[Playback Options\] menu (see section Playback
options on page 216).
