Randomising Effects
-------------------

This example shows you how to use the pixel mapper to create an effect
where random dimmer cells turn on. This effect will overlay any existing
intensities.

1. The fixtures you want to use need to be recorded into a group, *do
this first if they are not already*

2. Adjust the layout of the fixtures in the group using \[Shapes And
Effects\], \[Pixel Mapper\], \[Edit Group Layout\], *(select group)*

3. Start creating an effect by selecting the group then \[Shapes And
Effects\], \[Pixel Mapper\], \[Create Effect\]

4. In the Pixel Mapper Effect Editor window toggle the context menu
option \[Fixture Overlay\] until it reads \[Fixture Overlay 50/50\]\
*This will allow you to see the relationship of your fixtures to the
effect as you create it*
![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Fixture Overlay 50/50](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Fixture-Overlay-50-50.png)

5. Select \[Effect\] and drag **Background Opacity** slider to **0%**\
*This will allow the whole effect to overlay any related intensities*
![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Setting Background Opacity of Effect](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Setting-Background-Opacity-of-Effect.png)

6. Select \[Layer 1\], click \{+\} at the bottom of the screen and then
choose **Circle** from the elements that appear
![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Adding a Circle to Layer 1](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Adding-a-Circle-to-Layer-1.png)

7. Drag the **Zoom** slider until the circle covers approximately one
cell. You can also use the **Width** and **Height** sliders to turn the
circle into an oval if that helps.

    Then drag the **X** and **Y** sliders to position the circle roughly in
    the centre of your fixtures if it is not already.
    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Transforming a Circle Element](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Transforming-a-Circle-Element.png)

8. Select \{+\} again and choose **Displacement** from the animations that
appear (this is represented as a few static blocks)
![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - ](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper.png)  
Note that nothing changes yet

9. Select \{+\} and this time choose **Opacity** animation (represented as
a block fading in).

10. Modify the effect:

    The displacement acts on the opacity animation causing it to appear at
    random locations each time it is drawn.

    Drag the **In Time** and **Out Time** sliders to 0%. (This will cause
    the effect to snap on/off instead of fade.)

    Increase the **Speed** and **Spawn Rate** settings to make the effect
    run quicker and with more circles respectively. (High spawn rates are
    particularly useful for small randomised elements like this.)

Overlaying Effects
------------------

This example shows you how to create a diagonal white wipe with a
rotating red fan on top.

1. Select a group containing a fixture layout as described in [previous
example](#randomising-effects)

2. Start creating an effect by selecting the group then \[Shapes And
Effects\], \[Pixel Mapper\], \[Create Effect\]

3. Select \[Layer 1\], click \{+\} at the bottom of the screen and then
choose Block from the elements that appear.

    Drag the **Rotation** slider to the right to angle the element at
    approximately 25 degrees.

    Drag the **Width** slider to the left to make a thinner block.

    Drag the **Height** slider to the right until the block fills the height
    of the entire window.

    Drag the **X** slider to the right until the block is just off the
    screen.

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Transforming a Block](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Transforming-a-Block.png)

4. Click \{+\} again and choose **Linear Movement Animation** (represented
as a block moving left to right).

    On the right side of the **Direction** slider there is a compass button.
    Click on this four times until the direction reads 270 degrees. (By
    default the animation is set to 90 degrees or left to right. Because we
    placed the block on the far right of the screen we want it to move the
    other way. The compass gives shortcuts to the more common directions in
    45 degree increments.)

    Reduce **Spawn Rate** until only one stripe is on screen the same time.
    For this type of effect the value will usually need to be quite low -
    approximately 0.2.

    You might want to reduce **Speed** slightly at this point. (Note that a
    higher speed was initially useful for getting the correct spawn rate
    above.)

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Modify a Linear Movement Animation](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Modify-a-Linear-Movement-Animation.png)

5. Click on \[Layer 2\], select \{+\} and select the Swirl element
(represented by a **fan** shape with four arms).

    Increase **Zoom** until it is as large as will fit in the screen.

    Set **Bend** to 0% for nice straight fan blade edges.

    Set **Points** to 3 (minimum) for a three bladed fan.

    Set **Thickness** to 50% for evenly sized segments.

    Increase **Border Width** to a low value so that we just have an
    outline.

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Modifying Swirl](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Modifying-Swirl.png)

6. Click on \{+\} and add a spin animation.

    Reduce the speed until it just causes a light breeze.

7. Click in the top of this layer to get the layer controls.

    Click on the colour bar to open the colour picker.

    Click and drag to the top left of the picker window to get a strong red.

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Changing Colour of Swirl to Red](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Changing-Colour-of-Swirl-to-Red.png)

8. Click on \[Effect\] at the top left to access the global controls.

    Drag **Pre Spool** to the left until it reads 0s. *(This is to ensure the
    wipe begins off screen where we placed it when it is fired.)*

9. \<Record\> to a playback

>   Note how the red fan sits on top of the white bar when they
    interact. This is because the white is on a lower layer. A higher
    layer number has priority over a lower number.

Creative Use of Fixture Layouts
-------------------------------

Because each fixture group can contain a different layout it is possible
to create more than one arrangement of the same fixtures for pixel
mapping.

By arranging fixtures in certain layouts you can easily achieve complex
effects.

### Example 1: Odd/Even

1. Select your fixtures

2. Open the Selection Pattern menu by pressing the \<All\> key

3. Choose \[Odd\] from the softkey options\
*This will select all the odd numbered fixtures according to fixture order.*

4. Record a group.

5. Press \<+1\> (or \<Next\>) key\
*This will select all the even numbered fixtures.*

6. Merge this into the first group

7. Open the Layout Editor \[Shapes And Effects\], 
\[Pixel Mapper\], \[Edit Group Layout\], (**select group**)

By doing the above you should be able to see how we have quickly created
a layout where the all the odd fixtures are arranged together on the
left followed by all the even fixtures on the right.

This arrangement could be used as it is. A block element animated to run
horizontally left to right will run across all your odd fixtures
followed by all the even fixtures.

An alternative goal might be a vertical **cascading** effect:

1. Click on the **vertical resize tool** and drag down until the grid is at
least twice the original height\
![Layout Editor - Expanding Layout Grid](/docs/images/Layout-Editor-Expanding-Layout-Grid.jpeg)

2. Drag a marquee select across the **even fixtures**\
![Layout Editor - Selecting Fixtures](/docs/images/Layout-Editor-Selecting-Fixtures.jpeg)

3. Drag the selected fixtures so they sit directly under the odd
fixtures\
![Layout Editor - Moving Fixtures](/docs/images/Layout-Editor-Moving-Fixtures.jpeg)

4. Select **Crop Grid** from the Layout Editor context menu. (This will
get rid of the unused pixels.)

Now a block element animated to run vertically from top to bottom will
run down the odd fixtures followed by the even fixtures.

### Example 2 - Pseudo Random

1. Select your fixtures and create a group.

2. Open the Layout Editor.

3. Click on the vertical resize tool and drag down until the grid is at
least twice the original height.  
Note that to help with creation and manipulation of larger grids you can
    use the zoom control on the left-side of the window. Clicking on the
    magnifying glass gives a quick shortcut to zoom in/out.

4. Select the group again. (This will quickly select everything in the
layout.)

5. Press \<+1\> key\
    **This will select the first fixture**

6. Use the wheel to adjust **Position Y**

7. **Repeat steps 5 and 6** until all the fixtures are at different heights in
relation to one another

![Layout Editor - Randomly Arranged Fixtures](/docs/images/Layout-Editor-Randomly-Arranged-Fixtures.jpeg)

*If you create an effect using this group it will appear to be random.
Adjustments can be made to the layout at any time to fine-tune the end
result*.

### Example 3 - Angles (or "when straight just isn't good enough...")

Sometimes we like to hang fixtures at artistic angles to look pretty. By
default the software assumes you have hung them vertically but fear not -
Titan has a solution:

1. Select your fixtures and create a group

2. Open the **Layout Editor**

3. Select the fixture(s) that you want to angle and use the appropriate
wheel to control.\
If wheels are not assigned to control the cell layout
you can toggle this on/off using the context menu item **Wheel
Control**. Also, on the Pearl Expert you may need to select **Adjust
Angle** and to return wheels to controlling position select **Adjust
X,Y**.

![Layout Editor - Adjusting Angle](/docs/images/Layout-Editor-Adjusting-Angle.jpg)

Note that underneath the visual representation of the fixtures the
actual cells used are shown in light grey.

If any of your fixtures have been naughty and ended up beyond the bounds
of the grid after rotating you can use context menu item **Crop Grid**
to make them behave.

When using the wheels to move fixtures, you can click on the "up" and
"down" areas in the wheel display to nudge the values up and down: 1
pixel for position and 45 degrees for rotate. If you press the \<@\> button
for the wheel, a window opens allowing you to type in the values
numerically.

Other Layout Editor Tools
-------------------------

The Layout Editor's context menu has some useful tools for laying out
fixtures quickly.

**Arrange Fixtures:** This is a very useful tool to quickly layout
fixtures in a grid. For example you might have 20x colour blocks across
four towers, each with five blocks.

1. Select the fixtures and create a group

2. Open the **Layout Editor**

3. Select **Arrange Fixtures** from the context menu

4. Select the \[Height\] softkey and type \<5\>\
*Width will automatically be calculated*

5. Toggle \[Crop Grid to fixtures\] so that it is highlighted\
*This will make the grid adjust to fit*

6. Toggle \[Arrange in...\] to **Columns** or **Rows**\
**Rows** will arrange fixtures left to right and **Columns** will arrange top to
bottom.

7. The \[Shape\] option allows you to arrange in Rectangle, Oval or
Triangle

8. Select \[OK\] to complete

**Highlight:** When enabled this will highlight selected fixtures live
on stage. This can be useful to see which fixture you are positioning in
the layout.

**Position & Angle/Cell Scale:** When set to 'Position & Angle' the
wheels move and rotate the fixtures. When set to 'Cell Scale' the wheels
change the size of the fixture by spreading out its cells. This is
useful to get the correct layout if you have some large fixtures with
widely spaced cells and others with cells close together.

**Arrange/Select Only:** When set to **Arrange** you can move fixtures by
clicking and dragging on the screen. When set to **Select Only**
fixtures are locked in position on the grid and cannot be dragged
around. This provides an alternative way of selecting fixtures to edit
while preventing accidental movement.

*If you find you suddenly cannot move anything around this is probably
the reason!*

For either setting you can still use the wheels to move and rotate the
fixtures.

**Wheels Move Full Pixel/Sub Pixel:** Allows you to position fixtures
across pixel boundaries when using the wheels. The **Snap** option
centres the fixture on the nearest cell.

**Wheels Rotate Individual Fixtures/Selection:** Sets whether individual
fixtures rotate, or whether the whole selection rotates.

**Media options:** Shows a sub menu with useful options when you're
using Synergy/Ai to play back media on the fixture. These options are
described in [Layout Editor with Ai Server](../synergy/operating-synergy.md#layout-editor-with-ai-server).

Playback Order and Priorities
-----------------------------

Suppose you wished to create a white pulsating oval on one playback and
a blue spiral on a second playback. Normally these effects would layer
differently depending on the order you fire the playbacks, but you can
use playback priorities to make them always layer the same way

To create first effect:

1. Select a group containing a fixture layout as described in previous
example and go to \[Create Effect\]

2. Select \[Effect\] to access the global effect controls and change
**Background Opacity** to zero\
*This will allow it to overlay the other playback*

3. Double-Click \[Layer 1\] (or press \{+\}) and choose **Circle** from the
elements that appear\
*Double-click is a shortcut to elements and animations*

    Reduce height to make a rugby ball (or American football if you
    insist)

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Editing Height of Circle](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Editing-Height-of-Circle.png)

4. Double-click on \[Circle\] (or press \{+\}) and select the **Zoom**
animation

    Drag **In Time** to 0% and **Out Time** to 100%. (This will make the
    effect start large and finish small. Alternatively the same effect can
    be created by making **Start Zoom** larger than **End Zoom**.)

    Increase **End Zoom** until the element begins by filling the whole
    window.

5. Double-click on \[Zoom Animation\] (or press \{+\}) and select the
**Opacity animation**

    Reduce **Spawn Rate** to zero. (This will ensure the opacity only works
    on the zoom animation.)

    Drag **In Time** to 0% and **Out Time** to 100. (This will make the
    effect snap on and fade out as it reduces in size. As with zoom you can
    achieve much the same thing by inverting the opacity controls instead.
    Using opacity values greater than 100% will create a delay before
    fade.)

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Opacity Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Opacity-Animation-Settings.png)

6. Click on \[Effect\] again and reduce **Master Speed** to your
preference. (Adjusting the global speed control ensures the zoom and
opacity animations are synchronised instead of having to manually match
the individual values.)\
    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Effect Master Speed](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Effect-Master-Speed.png)

7. \<Record\> to a playback

Next we will create the second effect:

1. Select the same group as used for the first effect and \[Create
Effect\]

2. Select \[Effect\] and change **Background Opacity** to zero.

3. Select \[Layer 1\] and this time add a **Spiral** element

    Increase **Zoom** so that it's nice and big.

    Drag **Thinning** until it is at **0%**. (This will make the lines of the
    spiral stay the same width. A negative value means the spiral gets
    thinner towards the outside; a positive value means it gets thinner
    towards the inside.)

    Reduce **Turns** so we can make a more bold effect. Approx. 3 should
    work.

    Increase **Thickness** to **50%** for chunky lines.

    Increase **Exponent** to around **25%**. (This causes the spiral to
    **expand** at a faster rate.)
    
    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Modifying a Spiral](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Modifying-a-Spiral.png)

4. Add a **Spin** animation for genuine psychedelic effect.

    Adjust speed until you are unable to look away from the screen.

5. Select the Layer to show the layer controls and change the colour to
blue using the colour picker.\
![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Changing Colour of Spiral Layer to Blue](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Changing-Colour-of-Spiral-Layer-to-Blue.png)

6. \<Record\> to a playback

Now let's look at how they interact on the playbacks:

-   Fire the blue spiral effect

-   Fire the white pulse

Notice how the white takes priority over the spiral. The blue spiral
only appears as the white oval fades out and gets smaller.

-   Kill both effects

-   Fire the white pulse

-   Fire the blue spiral

This time the blue spiral sits on top of the white pulse. That is
because the playbacks are following a **latest takes precedence** rule
(LTP).

To guarantee the blue spiral always sits on top you can set it to be a
higher priority:

1. Kill both effects

2. Press \<Options\> (or \[Options\] from the top level menu) - see [Playback Options](../cues/playback-options.md)

3. **Select** the blue spiral playback

4. Press \[Previous\] or \[Next\] until you can see \[Priority Normal\]
    on the softkeys. Press this to toggle it to \[Priority High\].

5. Now fire the blue spiral followed by the white pulse.

Even though you fired them in the same order as the first example the
blue spiral now sits on top of the white pulse because it has a higher
priority.

Displacement and Layer Properties
---------------------------------

In this example we create random flashing bars, and use layer controls
to make global adjustments to the whole effect.

1. Create a group and adjust the fixture layout as described in
previous examples

2. Select this group and begin creating an effect

3. Select \[Layer 1\] and add a **Block** element.

4. Adjust the **width** and **height** sliders until we have a thin strip that
covers at least one cell vertically and the whole grid horizontally.

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Adjusting Width and Height of a Block](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Adjusting-Width-and-Height-of-a-Block.png)

5. Reduce **Y** until the bar disappears off the top of the grid. (This is
in preparation for adding a displacement animation.)

6. Add a **Displacement animation**. By default this will offset the
original position by anything up to 30% distance. This is because the
default value for **Distance** is set to a maximum of 30% and **Distance
Random** is set to 100% meaning it can use any random value between zero
and 30%. Similarly **Direction Random** is set to 100% meaning it can
offset in any direction.

    Temporarily set **Distance Random** to 0%. (This is in order to see
    exactly what the displacement is doing.)

    Set **Direction Random** to 0 degrees. (In this example we do not require a
    random direction.) Now the bar will disappear because it is being
    displaced upwards in the default settings.

    Set **Direction** to 180 degrees. Click on the compass button four times
    to get there quickly. Now the bar should reappear on the screen because
    it has been offset vertically down from the our off-screen position by
    the default 30%.

    Increase **Distance** until the bar is approximately in the centre.\
    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Displacement Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Displacement-Animation-Settings.png)

7. Add an **Opacity animation**

    Reduce **In Time** and **Out Time** to create a snapping effect.\
    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Opacity Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Opacity-Animation-Settings-2.png)

8. Click on **Displacement** in the Layer to get back to the controls
for this animation again.

    Now increase **Distance Random** to 100%. (This will make the bar draw
    at a random offset around the **Distance** setting, in this case making
    it anywhere within the grid.)

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Displacement Animation Direction Random Setting](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Displacement-Animation-Direction-Random-Setting.png)

9. Return to the **Opacity animation** controls and increase speed until
you're happy.  
At this point you may decide actually the effect would be better if
it was a vertical bar. To make this easy we can make adjustments on the
layer controls rather than on the individual element and animations:

10. Select \[Layer 1\] to bring up the layer controls.

11. Change **Rotation** to 90 degrees by clicking on the compass button
twice.\
![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Changing Layer Rotation](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Changing-Layer-Rotation.png)

Now you have a vertical bar that draws randomly using a horizontal
displacement. Similarly you can use the \[layer\] or \[effect\] controls
to make global changes to **X/Y position** and **Zoom** allowing quick
manipulation of entire effects.

Spawn and Pre-Spool
-------------------

The director has asked for lots of animated spinning shurikens that
slowly move across a backdrop while pulsating. It is a mystery why, but
you know how it is with directors.

1. Select a group with an appropriate layout

2. Add a **Star** element

    Change **Points** to 4 for a classic shuriken.

    Reduce **Zoom** so that we can fit lots of baby shurikens in the grid.

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Modifying a Star Element](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Modifying-a-Star-Element.png)

3. Add a **Spin animation**

    Reduce **Speed** so they are relatively harmless.

4. Add a **Linear Movement animation**

    Slow it down so it looks like it is rolling along.

5. Select the Star element again and change **X** so the shuriken
starts further from the left and rolls along the whole grid.

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Transforming Star Element](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Transforming-Star-Element.png)

6. Add a **Displacement animation**

    Now each new shuriken starts rolling at a different height on the grid.

7. Go back to the Linear Movement animation and increase **Spawn Rate**
so that more shurikens are on screen at once. (This determines how
frequently a new element appears.)

    Increase **Direction Random** slightly. (This will allow a random
    variation in the direction of travel based upon the **Direction**
    value.)

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Linear Movement Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Linear-Movement-Settings.png)

8. Add a **Zoom animation**

    Reduce **Spawn Rate** to 0%. (This is a special setting that will
    allow the zoom animation to run continuously during the life of a
    shuriken. If the rate is set to 1 it will only run once and the
    shurikens will quickly disappear as a result.)

    Increase **Out Time** to 100%. (This will make the shurikens pulse in
    and out with a **bounce** type effect. I have no idea why they would be
    doing this in reality.)

    Slow the zoom down a bit.

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Zoom Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Zoom-Animation-Settings.png)

9. Click on \[Effect\] and set **Pre-Spool** to 0%\
*This is to demonstrate the purpose of the property.*

    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Zoom Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Zoom-Animation-Settings-2.png)

10. \<Record\> to a playback

11. Press clear, open the **Pixel Mapper Preview** workspace and fire the
cue

    You will notice that initially there are no shurikens on the screen and
    it takes a while to build up to a nice random collection. To fix that we
    can use **Pre-Spool**.

12. \<Include\> the cue and open the **Effect Editor** workspace if it is not
already open

13. Select \[Effect\] and increase the **Pre-Spool** value to around
20s. (This means the software will pretend 20 seconds has already
elapsed when the effect is started.)

14. \<Record\> to a playback, \<Clear\>, fire and view again in the **Pixel Mapper
Preview**

    This time there should already be plenty of shurikens on screen.
    Pre-Spool is particularly useful for animations that rely on high spawn
    rates but run at a low speed.
