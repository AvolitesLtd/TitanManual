Welcome to Avolites Titan! This manual aims to you tell you everything
there is to know about operating your Avolites console.

If you're already familiar with using lighting consoles but new to Titan, 
the [Quick Start](./quick-start.md) section explains most common actions.

After that we try to take you through all the things you will need to know in the order
that you're most likely to need them, so we start with how to [connect up the console](./titan-basics.md),
then look at [patching lights](./patching.md). After that we go through [how to control](./controlling-fixtures.md) the different
attributes of the lights, then how to store frequently-used settings in [palettes](./palettes.md).
Titan has some great built-in [effects](./effects.md), so we look at those, then how to build a show
by recording [cues](./cues.md), [chases](./chases.md), [cue lists](./cue-lists.md)
and [timelines](./timelines.md). 
Later there are sections on [Capture Visualiser](./capture-visualiser.md), 
the video integration system [Synergy](./synergy.md), help when [running a show](./running-the-show.md), [remote control](./remote-control.md) of the console from a phone or tablet,
and [system settings](./system-settings.md) to configure how the console works. 

Finally, we end up with a [glossary](./glossary.md) which covers some of the lighting terms
which get used in this manual, and also explains some of the terms which mean
different things on other brands of console.

Happy programming!
