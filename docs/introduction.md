Welcome to Avolites Titan. This manual aims to you tell you everything
there is to know about operating your Avolites console (that's quite a lot).

If you're already familiar with using lighting consoles but new to Titan, 
the Quick Start section tells you how to do the most common things.

After that we try to take you through all the things you will need to know in the order
that you're most likely to need them, so we start with how to connect up the console,
then look at patching lights. After that we go through how to control the different
attributes of the lights, then how to store frequently-used settings in palettes.
Titan has some great built-in effects, so we look at those, then how to build a show
by recording cues, chases and cue lists. Later there are sections on Capture Visualiser, 
the video integration system Synergy, help when running a show, remote console control,
and system options. 

Finally we end up with a glossary which covers some of the lighting terms
which get used in this manual, and also explains some of the terms which mean
different things on other brands of console.

You can use the search box top right to look for particular terms, or read
the chapters in sequence using the left sidebar.

Happy programming!
