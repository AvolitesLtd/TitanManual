Before the console can talk to another device over the network, it has
to be given a unique network address. This is called its "IP address".

Setting the console's IP address
--------------------------------

We recommend that you use the console's automatic IP setting function.
However, if you need to you can also set a manual IP address. See [Setting your IP address](a-quick-guide-to-ip-addressing.md#setting-your-ip-address) for
details of how IP addressing works.

1. Go to the **System** menu (press \<Avo\> + \<Disk\>) and press \[Network Settings\]

2. Press \[Local Area Connection\] (some consoles have more than
	one network connection, so you may have different connections to 
	choose from)

3. Check \[Subnet Mask\] is set to `255.255.255.0`

4. Press \[Set IP `2.*.*.*`\]

5. Press \[Save settings\]

6. \<Exit\> the system menu.

-   Some Art-Net equipment may operate on a fixed IP address range of
	2.\*.\*.\* or 10.\*.\*.\*, in which case you will need to also
	set the console within the same range, but most equipment can be set
	to any address.

-   If you need an address range other than 2.\*.\*.\* or 10.\*.\*.\* 
	you can press \[IP Address = ... \] and enter the address with the numeric keypad.

Setting up DMX outputs
----------------------

The console has 64 DMX output lines, of which the console itself can
output 16, with further lines available using networked DMX processing
nodes. The T1 dongle is limited to one DMX line, T2 to two DMX lines. The
lines may be routed to physical DMX sockets on the console and/or to network nodes.
The simulator will output one universe over Art-Net.

You connect console output lines to network universes using the
[DMX Settings menu](../system-settings/dmx-output-mapping.md#configuring-dmx-outputs).
Often you will simply allocate console line 1 to network universe 1, line 2 to
universe 2 and so on, but there are times (for example if using a house rig
with a touring show) when you might need to allocate the lines differently.


Example of a simple Art-Net system
-----------------------

There are two main systems for sending lighting control
information over a network, Art-Net and sACN. Titan supports both; in this 
section we will describe how to set up a system using Art-Net.

Art-Net is not specific to one range of products, and is recognised and
implemented by a growing number of manufacturers. Many products (such as
Dimmers and Moving lights) can accept the Art-Net signal directly, so
there is no need to convert the signal to DMX. Most people will,
however, need to output DMX to their equipment and this can be done
using an Art-Net to DMX converter (often called a **Node**).

In the following diagram, an Art-Net compliant Console (such as a Titan
console) is connected via a network switch to an Art-Net compatible dimmer
and a rackmount DMX conversion node.

![Art Net Explanation
general](/docs/images/Art-Net-Explanation-General.png)

Once the system is connected together, the devices
can be configured.

-   On the Dimmer, set the start address of 1.001 (Address 001 on universe 1)

-   On the DMX node, set start at universe 2 so it will convert universes 2-13 to DMX512 on its 12 outputs


The [DMX Settings menu](../system-settings/dmx-output-mapping.md#configuring-dmx-outputs) 
on the console is used to set which DMX line
on the console is output to each Art-Net universe (1-256). Each console
line may be output to multiple universes (including the physical connectors on the 
console) depending on how your devices are connected.

If everything is connected right, you should see each universe of the Dimmer 
and the DMX node show up as connectable devices on the left hand side of the 
DMX Settings window. The devices will tell the console what universe they are 
set to receive.

So we do the following:

-   Click on the first universe of the dimmer on the left of the window,
	then click Line 1 on the right to connect it.

-   Click on the first universe of the DMX node on the left of the window,
	then click Line 2 on the right to connect it.

-   Click on the second universe of the DMX node on the left of the window,
	then click Line 3 on the right to connect it.

![Art Net Explanation Nodes to
DMX](/docs/images/Art-Net-Explanation-Nodes-to-DMX.png)

Now on the console when you patch, you will patch the dimmer channels on addresses 1.001 - 1.024, the
fixtures on the first output of the 12-way DMX node will be on addresses 2.001 - 2.512 and
the fixtures on the second output will be on addresses 3.001 - 3.512.

- Press the small \{Cog\} button on the Art-Net device to show a properties window. 
	See [Art-Net settings](../system-settings/dmx-output-mapping.md#art-net-properties)
	for an explanation of the settings.

\"Unpolled\" and \"unknown\" devices may appear as Art-Net nodes.

-   An unpolled device is a \'rolling extra\' which allows more than 4
    connections to be made to a particular Art-Net device. The Art-Net
    specification only allows each device to advertise a max of 4
    universes so if you need to add more the console has to invent the
    5th, 6th, etc universes.

-   An unknown device is one which doesn't format an Art-Net poll reply
    properly so the console doesn't known if it is an input or output
    device.
