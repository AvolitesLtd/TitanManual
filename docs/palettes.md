When programming a show you will find that you frequently use certain
positions, colours, etc. The console lets you store these settings so
you can recall them at the touch of a button rather than having to find
them on the wheels every time. This is very useful for rapid programming
and when busking a show.

When you use a palette to [record a cue](cues/creating-a-cue.md#creating-a-cue),
the console stores a reference
to the palette, rather than the actual value. This means that if you
program your cues using palettes, you can easily change all the
positions in your show just by reprogramming a few palette entries
rather than having to reprogram all the cues. This is handy if you are
touring and have to cope with different stages or truss heights every
show.

Palettes can be <strong>[nested](palettes/creating-palettes.md#nested-palettes)</strong>
so you can use palettes in other palettes. If you
change a master palette, the changes will track through to all the
palettes in which it is used.

Palettes are stored and selected using the buttons in the <strong>Colours</strong>,
&nbsp;<strong>Gobos/Beams</strong> and <strong>Positions</strong> windows. You can also store palettes on 
Macro/Executor buttons or store and recall numerically from the keypad. 

You can [set a legend](palettes/creating-palettes.md#setting-legends-for-palettes)
for each button so that you know what you're going to get.

If the <strong>Colours</strong>, <strong>Positions</strong>, <strong>Gobos & Beams</strong> windows are not shown, open
the workspace <Keys.SoftKey>Groups and Palettes</Keys.SoftKey> to show all three windows.
