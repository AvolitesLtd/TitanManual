Once the **Prism One** has been started, a **System Tray** icon becomes available to access several features:

* The current port which is being used for **Prism One** - currently this is set to 9030
* **Open Command Line** gives access to full control of the application locally or remotely. A full list of the available commands can be seen by typing help. 
* **Open LUA Script** allows the use of scripts to execute predetermined actions within the application. 
* The **Exit** function allows you to fully close **Prism One**.
