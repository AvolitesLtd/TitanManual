This section is a quick guide on how to do most things on Avolites Titan
consoles. Each section has a link to take you to the appropriate manual
section for more details.

- <Keys.HardKey>This</Keys.HardKey> indicates a physical buttons on the console *(or <Keys.HardKey>Avo</Keys.HardKey> for red keys)*
- \[This\] indicates a softkey option on the touchscreen (the A-G menu buttons)
- <Keys.ContextKey>This</Keys.ContextKey> indicates an option in a context menu 

Most functions on Titan use the Workspace Windows shown on the touch screen(s).
To open different windows press the <Keys.HardKey>View</Keys.HardKey> button (on some consoles this is labelled <Keys.HardKey>Open Window</Keys.HardKey> -
the manual refers to this as the <Keys.HardKey>Open/View</Keys.HardKey> button). A selection of icons is
shown on each screen which you can press to open the different windows.
You can save different arrangements of windows to the Workspaces buttons
(either in a block to the left of the softkeys, or down the side of the screen,
depending on the console).
See [Workspace Windows](./titan-basics/workspace-windows.md) for more details.
