This section is a quick guide on how to do most things on Avolites Titan
consoles. Each section has a link to take you to the appropriate manual
section for more details.

Softkeys (the A-G menu buttons next to the screen) are shown like 
\[This\]. Physical labelled buttons on the console are
shown like \<This\>.

Most functions on Titan use the Workspace Windows shown on the touch screen(s).
To open different windows press the \<View\> button (on some consoles this is labelled \<Open Window\> -
the manual refers to this as the \<View/Open\> button). A selection of icons is
shown on each screen which you can press to open the different windows.
You can save different arrangements of windows to the Workspaces buttons
(either in a block to the left of the softkeys, or down the left side of the screen,
depending on the console).
See [Workspace Windows](../titan-basics/workspace-windows.md) for more details.
