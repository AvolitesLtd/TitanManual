If you connect the console to a wireless network, you can use the **Titan Remote** app on an Android or iOS mobile device
such as a smartphone or tablet for wireless remote control. This can be really useful when rigging,
testing and focusing. Also from the remote, you can run and store 
palettes and playbacks.

The **Titan Remote** app can be downloaded from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avolites.titanremote) or [Apple App
Store](https://apps.apple.com/ky/app/titan-remote/id688791174).

> In previous versions, the remote app had a version number which had to match the console software version.
  This is no longer the case and the app does not have a version number in its name.

The layout of the remote screen varies depending on the screen size of the device you are using. The
windows are not user-configurable.


You can connect multiple remotes to the console and the console itself
remains functional while the remote is connected. Each remote runs like a multi-user
system with a **separate programmer** so an operator can continue to work on the console
while another user programs or updates palettes on the remote. 

- To clear all
changes from a remote, hold <Keys.HardKey>Clear</Keys.HardKey> on the console
and select <Keys.SoftKey>Clear all programmers</Keys.SoftKey>.
