If the layout of the fixture buttons, palettes or playbacks has become a
bit mixed up during programming, you can use the Move function to move
recorded items around and produce a better layout. When an item is
moved, all links to other recorded items are retained.

Using the Move function
-----------------------

To move fixtures, palettes, groups and playbacks is very simple.

1. Press \<Move\> to select Move mode (if the console does not have a **Move** button,
	you can get this function by holding \<Avo\> and pressing \<Copy\> ).

2. Press or touch the **Select** button(s) of the item(s) to move.

3. Press or touch the **Select** button of the destination.

When moving a range, it is possible to select a range containing
different types of items, and there can be gaps between them. In this
case, you can set \[Bunch Up\] mode to have all of the gaps in the range
removed.

\[Swap Items if Required\] will attempt to reposition any existing
handles which are in the way of the move. This is useful when
rearranging handles on a page which is nearly full.

-   If there is not enough space, (there is an item in the way or there
    is not enough space before the end of the page) then the action will
    not be completed.

-   Press \<Latch Menu\> to keep Move mode active if you have a number
    of things to move around.
