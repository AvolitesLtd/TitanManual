===============================

The Shape Generator in Titan (sometimes known as an Effects Generator on
other consoles) allows you to quickly create exciting light shows using
lots of movement and changes, with the minimum of programming. A range
of speed controls allow you to modify how the shapes appear at showtime
giving you a whole range of effects from a few basic stored cues.

You can use the conventional Shape Generator with preset patterns, or
the Key frame Shape Generator which allows you to create your own custom
patterns.

The Pixel Mapper is used to generate animated textures using the colour
or intensity of a group of fixtures (often LED battens, starcloths or
LED web type fixtures). When viewed at a distance the effect becomes
clearly visible.
