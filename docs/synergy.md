Titan includes Avolites Synergy software which allows you full control over one or more networked Ai media servers or the Avolites Prism Zero media application.  Not only can you control playback of media and effects, but also upload new media with automatic transcoding, create new screen fixtures and new layers on AI servers, and preview multiple media streams in the Titan workspaces.

For shows which include video content, this gives you a much smoother workflow when creating and running the show.

> Ai refers to media outputs as "Screen Fixtures". To avoid confusion with Titan fixtures, Titan doesn't use "Fixture" and refers to them as **"Screens"** (and in some places **"Surfaces"**).
