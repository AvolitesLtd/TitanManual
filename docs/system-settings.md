The console has a large number of options to help you set it up just the
way you like it. Commonly used options can be set from the User Settings
menu which is available on a softkey when you hold down the <Keys.HardKey>Avo</Keys.HardKey>
button.

The System menu itself allows you to set up the console hardware including physical DMX outputs,
network ports, external monitors and so on.

In this chapter there is also information on how to upgrade the
Titan software.
