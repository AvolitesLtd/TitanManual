The console runs on an embedded PC system, and like all computers, there
is a possibility of system failure. The console software can be reloaded
using the recovery USB stick provided with the console, or you can
download a recovery disk creator application from the [Downloads section of
the Avolites website](https://www.avolites.com/software/latest-version) which will automatically create a recovery stick.

> It may take up to 60 minutes to reinstall the software on the console.

There are three types of recovery available:

Recovery | Version installed | Shows | Personalities | Licence
---|---|---|---|---
Standard Recovery | Two most recent | Preserved |Preserved | Preserved
Factory Restore | Recovery version + most recent | Deleted | Recovery version | Preserved
Full Erase | Recovery version | Deleted | Recovery version| <em>Deleted/Preserved</em>

> With software version 12 or above the licence is stored on the AvoKey, and
  even a Full Erase Recovery doesn't delete it, [see below](#software-licensing).

> Using <strong>Factory Restore</strong> or <strong>Full Erase</strong> will delete all settings and files from the console including show files and user personalities. Any files should be saved to a USB stick before continuing.

Detailed instructions on creating and using a recovery stick can be
found with the recovery creator on the [Avolites website](https://www.avolites.com/software/); depending on
the variety and age of your console there are a number of different
methods required. The basic procedure is as follows:

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. &nbsp<strong>If recovering a version earlier than v11.1</strong>, you will need to set theconsole to boot from USB *(see instructions on the [Avolites website](https://www.avolites.com/software/),
which vary depending on your console)*

2. Start console and wait while the memory stick boots up, this can
take up to 3 minutes.

3. Once the memory stick has booted, the touch screen will display
'Welcome to (Console Name)', touch <strong>Next</strong> to continue.

4. Please read to the bottom of the licence agreement then touch <strong>Agree</strong>
to accept.

5. Select the type of recovery you want to perform <em>(see table above)</em>

6. On the next screen check the serial number of the console - this is
the number written on the back of the console and should be already
filled in for you.

7. Touching <strong>Install</strong> will then begin the recovery

8. Once complete unplug the memory stick and touch the <strong>Restart</strong> button.

After starting the console will install all the software and drivers
required to run. This takes approximately 30 minutes to complete during
which the console will reboot a number of times. Please do not switch
off the console during this process.

Software Licensing
------------------

From v12, the software is licensed using an AvoKey USB device.

The Authenticator wizard will take you through the steps to license the
software on your console or computer. Once the license is stored on the
AvoKey, you should not need to repeat the licensing. For Titan Mobile or
T1/T2 dongles, this allows you to use different computers without
relicensing as long as the Avolites hardware is connected.
