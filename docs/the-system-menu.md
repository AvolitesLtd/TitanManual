===============

The System menu is accessed by holding \<Avo\> and pressing Disk. Some
consoles are also fitted with a key switch or mode switch to select
System mode.

The options in this menu are separated from the other options on the
console because you would normally only change them occasionally, or
because they can have serious effects on the way the console works and
you wouldn't want to change them accidentally.

Titan Telemetry
---------------

To help Avolites with software development and bug fixing, the console
will report anonymous information to Avolites. This includes details
about faults that occur, statistics on how long certain functions take,
and usage of functions. This information is really useful for improving
the software, however if you would prefer to disable it, click the
\[Telemetry Enabled\] button to switch it to \[Telemetry Disabled\].
Telemetry information will only be sent in any case if the console is
connected to the internet.

Display Setup
-------------

This option gives you a menu for enabling and disabling external
monitor(s). If you don't have a monitor connected, set this option to
"Disabled" to improve the performance of the console.
