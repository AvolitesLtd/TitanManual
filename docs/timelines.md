Timelines allow you to create a precisely timed light show which you can either
run from the console's internal timer or synchronise to an external timecode
source. This can be useful for an opening sequence for a corporate
event, a complex song in a show where the song is pre-recorded or run to 
a click track or timecode, or a multimedia event run to a playback track.

> You can also create timed shows by creating timecoded cues in 
[cue-lists](./cue-lists/cue-list-timing.md#running-a-cue-list-to-timecode), but Timeline 
recording allows much easier creation and editing of a timed show.

Timelines can be built either from cues or chases you have already recorded, or by creating
new cues as you go along. You can record them in real time by operating the console
or by adding cues manually at specific times. You can think of a timeline as an automatic replay
system to push the faders and buttons on the console. The actions recorded in a timeline
are called **triggers**.

To view the timeline edit window for a playback containing a timeline, touch the playback 
information area relating to the fader or press \<Open/View\> then the **select button** 
of the playback.
