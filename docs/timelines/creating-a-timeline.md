Programming a Timeline
----------------------

To program a timeline you record actions, or **Triggers**, at specific times
which can then be replayed by the console.

The following types of trigger can be recorded. You can live record these actions
or enter them manually using the touch screen.

Trigger             | Action
--------------------|----------
Set Level           | Set playback to a level over a fade time. This is like pushing up the fader over 2 seconds for example.
Go to cue           | Go to a cue in a cue list. You can either specify a cue number or just record a *Go* trigger to run the next cue, which will follow the fade times programmed in the cue list.
Flash               | Flash a playback
Timed Flash         | Flash a playback with programmed fade times
Timed Flash and Go  | Timed flash with Go, for a cue list
Swop                | Swop a playback (cancels all other playbacks while active)
Preload             | Preload the LTP values of a playback over a number of seconds
Marker              | Mark a point in the timecode for information
Wait for go         | Pause the timeline until you press Go to resume (only on internal timecode)
