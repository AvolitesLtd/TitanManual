When preparing a show it is often useful to create a report of how the
show is patched or programmed on the console, for example to give to a
crew when pre-rigging fixtures, or just for your records.

Reports can be created in HTML, PDF, CSV or XML formats for the
following:

-   Fixtures

-   Memory (Cues)

-   Chases

-   Cue Lists

-   Palettes

-   Groups

To generate reports:

1. Press the <Keys.HardKey>Disk</Keys.HardKey> button.

2. Press <Keys.SoftKey>Reports</Keys.SoftKey>.

3. Select the item(s) you want to include in the report

4. Select the format in which you want to output the report

5. Select the drive where you want to save the report

Reports are stored in the following folders:

PC suite (Editor/simulator, Titan Mobile., Titan Go):
`Documents/Titan/Reports`

All other consoles: `D:/Data/Reports`

When the report is complete, Titan will open the folder where the report
is stored so you can see where it went.
