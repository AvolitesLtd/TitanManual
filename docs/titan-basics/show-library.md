The Show Library window collects all the information about your show
into a single place. It is very useful to transfer programming when
importing parts of previous shows, or when moving shows to a Titan
consoles with fewer faders, but can also be used to move items around
within your show.

Press \<View/Open\> then \[Open Workspace Window\], \[Show Library\] to
open the window (or if in the root menu just \[Open Workspace Window\],
\[Show Library\]).

Show Library tab
----------------

The Show Library lists all programmed elements of your show including
fixture patch, fixture groups, palettes, playbacks, macros and
workspaces. Use the buttons down the left hand side to filter what types
of information are displayed.

![Show Library](/docs/images/Show-Library.png)Clicking on the buttons in the Show Library
window will activate them.

Mapping shows for import
------------------------

Press the Plus button top right to map another showfile to allow you to
import elements of it.

Using the Mapper tab you can map similar fixtures from an imported show
to the current show. This lets you load in your [favourite programming
from other shows](../titan-basics/loading-and-saving-shows.md#importing-parts-of-other-shows).

Users tab
---------

This tab allows you to set up and select users for the console. This is
the same as the \[Users\] option found in the Disk menu.

Key profiles view
-----------------

Selecting the [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md) tab shows all information about the different
Key Profiles available on the console. The available profiles are listed
down the left hand side, and the key allocations are shown on the right.
You can't change the Key Profiles using this screen, it's just for
viewing the settings.
