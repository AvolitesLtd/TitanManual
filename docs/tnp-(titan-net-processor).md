The TitanNet Processor is the insides of a console without the control
surface. It allows you to expand the number of DMX lines in a show
beyond the 16 which a console can produce by offloading the processing
into a separate unit.

It is also possible to improve robustness by running the whole show from
one or more TNP units onstage and having the console simply acting as a
remote control. The TNP can also act as a simple stand-alone controller
using the onboard touchscreen, or by connecting an external touchscreen
you can operate it using the Titan Go screen. It can load shows which
have been created on a full console. You can also use a console in
multi-user mode to create shows directly on the TNP.

Section 15 covers the operation of TNP.
