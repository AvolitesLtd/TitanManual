======================

The console operating software is under constant revision by the
Avolites team. You can always download the latest version of the
software from the Avolites website: http://www.avolites.com.

To swap between versions go to Switch Software on the Tools menu.

-   The Titan Mobile, Titan Go and Editor/Simulator software is
    installed simply by running the "PC Suite" installer program as with
    any other Windows application. Please ensure you have exited the
    Titan software before running the installer.

-   If you are upgrading the software from a version earlier than v12,
    you will have to obtain an AvoKey USB dongle from Avolites and
    license the software. See the next section for details of how to do
    this.

Software upgrades for consoles are installed from a USB pen drive.

Having downloaded a new version of software, copy it to the USB drive
and install it on the console like this:

1\> Copy the installer file to a USB drive and insert into the console.

2\> On the screen tools menu, stop the console software using the
Shutdown Software button at the bottom of the list.

3\> Open the tools menu again, touch the Folders icon and navigate to
the drive where the upgrade file is found.

4\> Run the installer by double clicking/double tapping.

5\> When the installation has completed, shut down the console and
restart it. This will allow any operating system updates to install.
