**No Liability for Consequential Damages**

Avolites has a policy of continuous product and documentation
improvement. As such the detail within this manual may not match the
operation of the console.

In no event shall Avolites be liable for any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages or loss whatsoever (including,
without limitation, damages for loss of profits, business interruption,
or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use or inability to use the
console even if Avolites Ltd. has been advised of the possibility of
such damages. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the
above limitation may not apply to you.

Avolites Ltd recognise that all trademarks within the manual are the
property of their respective owners.
