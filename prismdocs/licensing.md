# Player

Prism Player requires an internet connection to download the free software license. This is automatically installed as **"3501 Avolites Prism Player"**. The specific name of this license will appear in codemeter webadmin page, instructions are below.

If you have no internet connection, you will need to purchase an Avo Key requesting our free Prism Player License. If you require an Avo Key please speak to any of our [distributors](https://www.avolites.com/official-distributors).

If you already hold an Avo Key then you will need to request our **free** license from <a href="mailto:support@avolites.com?subject=Prism%20Zero:">support@avolites.com</a>

# Zero

Prism Zero will already work with your **Avo Key** or **Editor Keys**. Both can also be purchased from any of our distributors.
