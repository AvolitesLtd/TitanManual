## Prism Player

**Prism Player** runs with any valid **AvoKey** or **Editor Keys** with an **Ai** (_Demo_, _Anjuna_, _Bondi_, _Miami_) or **Prism** (_Player_, _Zero_, _One_) license.

**Prism Player** can be installed without an **AvoKey** or **Editor Keys**, in this case an internet connection to download the free software license is required. The license is automatically installed as **Prism Player Component** or **3501 Avolites Prism Player**. The specific name of this license will appear in codemeter webadmin page, instructions are below.

If you have no internet connection, and no **AvoKey** or **Editor Keys**, you will need to purchase an AvoKey requesting our free *Prism Player Component License*. If you require an AvoKey please speak to any of our distributors found [here](https://www.avolites.com/official-distributors).
