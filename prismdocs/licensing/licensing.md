# Prism Zero

Prism Zero will already work with your **AvoKey** or **Editor Keys**. Both can also be purchased from any of our distributors.

# Prism Player

_Important Note: valid for version (1.1)_

**Prism Player** requires an internet connection to download the free software license. This is automatically installed as **Prism Player Component** or **3501 Avolites Prism Player**. The specific name of this license will appear in codemeter webadmin page, instructions are below.

**Prism Player** already runs with any valid AvoKey with an Ai license (_Demo_, _Anjuna_, _Bondi_, _Miami_).

If you have no internet connection, and no AvoKey, you will need to purchase an AvoKey requesting our free Prism Player Component License. If you require an AvoKey please speak to any of our distributors found [here](https://www.avolites.com/official-distributors).

If Prism Player doesnâ€™t start, then please submit a support request to <a href="mailto:support@avolites.com?subject=Prism%20Zero:">support@avolites.com</a>
