# Prism Player

_Important Note: valid for version (1.1)_

**Prism Player** requires an internet connection to download the free software license. This is automatically installed as **Prism Player Component** or **3501 Avolites Prism Player**. The specific name of this license will appear in codemeter webadmin page, instructions are below.

**Prism Player** already runs with any valid **AvoKey** with an **AI** license (_Demo_, _Anjuna_, _Bondi_, _Miami_).

If you have no internet connection, and no **AvoKey**, you will need to purchase an AvoKey requesting our free *Prism Player Component License*. If you require an AvoKey please speak to any of our distributors found [here](https://www.avolites.com/official-distributors).

If Prism Player doesnâ€™t start, then please submit a support request to <a href="mailto:support@avolites.com?subject=Prism%20Zero:">support@avolites.com</a>

# Prism Zero

**Prism Zero** will already work with your **AvoKey** or **Editor Keys**. Both keys can also be purchased from any of our distributors.

**Prism Zero** is limited to 1 Surface, 1 Layer, and 1 Bank.

As mentioned on the [introduction](../zero/introduction), **"Free with a Key"** means that once a key is purchased you will be able to get the Prism Zero key on request for free.

# Prism

**Prism** requires purchasing both Key and License, this unlocks the use multiple Layers (up to 16) and Banks (up to 256) for better content organisation. As well as adding a few extra bank element types NDI Input, Live Input (webcam/capture card) and Virtual Return.
