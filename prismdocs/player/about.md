**Prism Player** is a standalone application built by **Avolites** to allow easy previewing of media files as well as for preparing and converting them using the **AiM codec**, ready for use in Ai.

**Prism Player** is composed of two parts - the **Server** and **UI**. The **Server** runs in the system tray and the **UI** will run separately and show the interface. The components communicate using **port 9030**, no other application must use this port in order to work. When starting **Prism Player** you may be prompted to add a firewall exception. If you have this experience please add this port to your firewall / anti-virus lists.

Please note that closing the **UI** doesn't automatically close the server, this allows for any encoding to carry on without showing the interface.

**Prism Player** has software protection, licenses are FREE. There must be an active internet connection for the license to install correctly. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@avolites.com?subject=Prism%20Player:">support@avolites.com</a> with any issues.
