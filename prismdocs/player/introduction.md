**Prism Player** is a free standalone auxiliary application built by **Avolites** and part of the **Prism Suite** of applications.

It allows for easy previewing of media files as well as for preparing and converting them using the **AiM codec**, ready for use in AI, [Prism Zero](../zero/introduction) or [Prism](../prism/introduction). Not only does **Prism Player** playback your favourite codecs such as *H264*, *HAP* and *Prores*, but it also supports playback of **NotchLC**.

![Prism Player UI](/prismdocs/images/prism-player-ui.png)

**Prism Player** is composed of two parts - the **Server** and the **UI**. The **Server** runs in the [system tray](./quick-start/system-tray.md) and the **UI** will run separately and show the interface. The components communicate using **port 9030**, no other application must use this port in order to work.

When starting **Prism Player** you may be prompted to add a firewall exception. If you have this experience please add this port to your firewall / anti-virus lists.

Please note that closing the **UI** doesn't necessarily close the server as this allows for any encoding to carry on behind the scenes. More infomation on this is found on the [General](./settings/settings-general) settings page.
