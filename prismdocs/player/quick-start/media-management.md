## Adding Media

Media can be added and played using several different methods:


- Selecting file(s) in your file explorer and dragging them onto the _"Drag drop or select"_ icon in the **Bank** area or at the bottom of the UI.
- Pressing the _"Select Files"_ button in the **Banks** or **Encoder** area.
- Dragging a file onto the **Media Player** will automatically add the video to the Bank and begin playing.
