### New Project
To create a **Prism Player** project, click on `File > New Project` or use the `Ctrl+N` shortcut.  
Creating a new project will reset all application settings.

**Encode list** media files and **Settings** are kept as they are not saved on project files but on separate files.

### Save Project

To save a **Prism Player** project, click on `File > Save` or use the `Ctrl+S` shortcut.  
The default destination folder of project files is in the **Documents** folder under `Avolites > Prism > Player > Projects`.  

Clicking on `File > Save As` or using the `Ctrl+Shift+S` shortcut will prompt the **Save Project As** dialog box where the project file name and the default destination folder can be changed.

When a project is saved in **Prism Player**, it will contain all application settings throughout the software.  

This includes all **Bank**, **Surface** and **Layers** settings.

### Open Project

To open a **Prism Player** project, click on `File > Open` or use the `Ctrl+O` shortcut.  
The default source folder of project files is in the **Documents** folder under `Avolites > Prism > Player > Projects`.  

Clicking on `File > Open Recent` will show the list of recently opened projects, with the most recent at the top.  
Selecting one of the projects form the list will open it.

Opening a previously saved project greatly reduces the setup time for a show and allows the recall of an earlier setup render queue without the need to rebuild it. When a project is opened, all settings across the application will be updated to those in the saved file.
