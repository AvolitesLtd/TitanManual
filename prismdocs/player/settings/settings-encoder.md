### Encoder

Unless a specific export destination has been set for an item in the **Encoderlist**, it will use the default locations specified here. Pressing the **Change Folder** button opens a dialogue allowing a new destination folder to be selected. This new location will then be shown in the **Default Folder** box.

If the **Auto Update Encodelist** option is active, all existing jobs in the **Encodelist** will have their export destinations updated to the newly specified **Default Folder**. When this is deactivated, only newly added jobs will default to this location whilst pre-existing jobs will retain their already specified output location.
