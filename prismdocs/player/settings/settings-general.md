### General

When **Keep Server Running On Close** is activated, when the main UI is closed the application will keep running in the system tray and continue with any assigned tasks. If this option is deactivated, closing the UI will exit the application fully regardless of its current state.

**Disable UI Notifications** is used to determine if messages from the application are displayed at the top of the **Prism Player** interface.

Using the **Graphics Card** dropdown allows the user to specify which GPU in the computer is used. The **AiM codec** makes use of hardware acceleration, so choosing the most powerful GPU in the system will benefit playback. Only DirectX 12 capable GPU's will be shown.

The **Audio Device** dropdown allows **Prism Player** to specify the output device separately from the main computer to create a dedicated preview feed.

**Undo History** provides feedback on the Undo function. The Total Steps determines how many undo actions can be made and Active Steps indicates the current position within the Total Steps.
