### Synergy

**Prism Zero** includes **Synergy** compatibility with **Avolites Titan**, providing easier setup as well as advanced features such as previewing of **Prism Zero** within **Titan**, using the output from **Prism Zero** within Titan's Pixelmapper and allowing media transfer directly from the console to **Prism Zero**.

The **Synergy** version in use must match the Titan version. If a missmatch is identified within Titan's **Synergy** Settings, a different version can be selected via this dropdown.

More information on how to setup a **Synergy** connection can be found [here](../../../../docs/synergy)

**Port** specifies which port is used to allow **Prism Zero** and **Titan** to communicate.

**Enable Synergy** is used to activate the **Synergy** connection between **Prism Zero** and the controlling device.

**Connection Status** indicates the current status of the **Synergy** connection between **Prism Zero** and **Titan**

The **Default Upload Folder** shows the storage location used by all media transfered to **Prism Zero** from **Titan** via a **Synergy** connection.

This may be adjusted using the **CHANGE FOLDER** button.
When activated, the **Auto Transcode** option will allow for automatic conversion of any files transferred to **Prism Zero** via **Synergy** without the need for user input.

When adjusting the **Group Layout** of fixtures within **Titan**, the **Position Overlay** tool can be used to ensure precise alignment of the fixtures within the area of the media surface. **Show / Hide Point Overlay** activates this visual feedback within **Prism Zero**.
