**Prism** is a standalone application built by **Avolites** that expands beyond the feature-set found in **Prism Player** and **Prism Zero**. On top of providing conversion, previewing and playback of media, **Prism** also adds **Synergy** compatibility with **Avolites Titan** allowing for full layer control, **NDI** previewing and use of the video output from **Prism** as a source for the **Pixelmapper** in **Titan**.

**Prism** is composed of two parts - the **Server** and **UI**. The **Server** runs in the system tray and the **UI** will run separately and show the interface. The components communicate using **port 9030**, no other application must use this port in order for **Prism** to work. When starting **Prism** you may be prompted to add a firewall exception. If you have this experience please add this port to your firewall / anti-virus lists.

Please note that closing the **UI** doesn't automatically close the server, this allows for any encoding or **Synergy** control to continue without showing the interface.
