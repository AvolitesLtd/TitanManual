This view shows surfaces and layers. It is possible to add, remove, duplicate or rename **Layers** and change **Surface** resolution.  
Currently Prism is limited to just **1 Surface** and can have up to **16 layers**, dependent on your specific hardware.  

Furthermore it is possible to control Physical and NDI outputs. In the latter case, resolution and frame rate can be changed.
A Region of Interest (RoI) can be set on both outputs.
