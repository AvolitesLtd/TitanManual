When a project is saved in **{{PRISM-APP}}**, it will contain all application settings throughout the software. This includes all **Bank** and **Encode List** settings as well as those found within the applicationâ€™s settings menu.

Loading a previously saved project greatly reduces the setup time for a show and allows the recall of an earlier setup render queue without the need to rebuild it. When a project is loaded, all settings across the application will be updated to those in the save file.

Saved files can be found in the Documents folder under `Avolites > Prism > {{PRISM-PATH}} > Projects`
