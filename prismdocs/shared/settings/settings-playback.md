This page shows the settings for the playback of media files.

![Settings Playback](/prism-images/settings/{{PRISM-APP-LOWER}}-settings-playback.png)

There are three sections:
- **[Playback](#playback)** - These options will give control over the media player.
- **[Hardware Accelerated Decoding (H.264/H.265)](#hardware-accelerated-decoding-h264h265)** - These options will give control over the media files decoding using H.264 and H.265 codecs.
- **[Renderer](#renderer)** - These options will give control over the renderer engine.

### Playback

|  Item  |  Description  |
|---------|-------------|
| **Step Amount** | This value will set the step forward or backward on the player timeline, expressed in seconds. To step forwards it is possible to use the right arrow key shortcut. To step backwards it is possible to use the the left arrow key shortcut. |
| **Resume Playback At Start** | Enable resuming playback. When enabled, if the app has been previously closed with playing media, once re-opened the media will resume playing. |

|  Item  |  Description  |
