### Synergy

**{{PRISM-APP}}** includes **Synergy** compatibility with **Avolites Titan**, providing easier setup as well as advanced features such as previewing of **{{PRISM-APP}}** within **Titan**, using the output from **{{PRISM-APP}}** within Titan's Pixelmapper and allowing media transfer directly from the console to **{{PRISM-APP}}**.

The **Synergy** version in use must match the Titan version. If a missmatch is identified within Titan's **Synergy** Settings, a different version can be selected via this dropdown.

More information on how to setup a **Synergy** connection can be found [here](../../../../docs/synergy).

**Port** specifies which port is used to allow **{{PRISM-APP}}** and **Titan** to communicate.

**Enable Synergy** is used to activate the **Synergy** connection between **{{PRISM-APP}}** and the controlling device.

**Connection Status** indicates the current status of the **Synergy** connection between **{{PRISM-APP}}** and **Titan**.

The **Default Upload Folder** shows the storage location used by all media transfered to **{{PRISM-APP}}** from **Titan** via a **Synergy** connection.

This may be adjusted using the **CHANGE FOLDER** button.
When activated, the **Auto Transcode** option will allow for automatic conversion of any files transferred to **{{PRISM-APP}}** via **Synergy** without the need for user input.

When adjusting the **Group Layout** of fixtures within **Titan**, the **Position Overlay** tool can be used to ensure precise alignment of the fixtures within the area of the media surface. **Show / Hide Point Overlay** activates this visual feedback within **{{PRISM-APP}}**.
