The **Stage** page is a place to setup your surfaces and layers, currently **Prism Zero** is limited to just **One Surface** and **One Layer**. Whilst **Prism** can have up to **16 layers**, dependent on your specific hardware. 

![Prism Stage Page](/prismdocs/images/{{PRISM-APP-LOWER}}-stage-surfaces.png)

There is the ability to rename layers / surfaces and reorder layers.

The resolution can be adjusted to match against your output settings.

<div style={{display: (`{{PRISM-APP-LOWER}}` === 'prism') ? '' : 'none'}}>

Clicking the <Keys.PrismKey>Sub menu</Keys.PrismKey> will show options for renaming, removing and duplication a layer.

*Note: When duplication a layer, their layer options will also be duplicated, you may want to reset the layer afterwards.*
