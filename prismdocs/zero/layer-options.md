The layer options provide real time control over parameters either directly from the UI or remotely by using DMX and is split into 3 sections. Pressing the Layer Options button in the UI opens the menu and then pressing one of the three section headings will expand it to show its available parameters. 

### Reset to Default 

**Reset To Default** is a quick way to reset all of the user adjusted parameters, just as a locate or home button would do on a console. 

### Sync to DMX 

When **Prism Zero** is being controlled from a lighting console, there might be an occasion where a quick adjustment of the parameters in the **Prism Zero** user interface can be preferable. This can result in a mismatch between the values on the console and within the interface.  

The **Sync To DMX** feature is used to allow the interface controls to immediately adjust to the most recently received **DMX** values from the console. This can be used anytime the UI needs to be kept in line with the external device values. 

### Playback 

Options found here are used to adjust which of the playlist entry's is being played, its **Playmode** and **Aspect Mode**, the **Trim in** and **Trim out** points for the current **Playlist** entry and a master **Volume control**.  

### Colour Correction 

**Colour Correction** adjustments are applied globally and allow the **Brightness**, **Red**, **Green**, **Blue**, **Hue** **Offset**, **Saturation**, **Contrast** and **Gamma** values to be controlled in realtime. 

### Transformation 

The **Transformation** section allows for independent control of **X** and **Y** **scaling**, **Translation** across the **X** and **Y** axes and **Rotation** around the **X**,**Y** and **Z** axes. All transformations are applied globally.
