## Adding Media

Media can be added and played using several different methods:
<div style={{display: (`zero` === 'player') ? '' : 'none'}}> 

- Selecting file(s) in your file explorer and dragging them onto the _"Drag drop or select"_ icon in the **Bank** area or at the bottom of the UI.
- Pressing the _"Select Files"_ button in the **Banks** or **Encoder** area.
- Dragging a file onto the **Media Player** will automatically add the video to the Bank and begin playing.

</div>

<div style={{display: (`zero` === 'zero' || `zero` === 'prism') ? '' : 'none'}}> 

- Selecting file(s) in your file explorer and dragging them onto the _"Drag drop or select"_ icon in the **Banks** area or at the bottom of the UI.
- Pressing the _"Select Files"_ button in the **Banks** or **Encoder** area.
- Dragging a file onto the [**Surface Mix**](../play/layers#surface-mix) area will automatically add the video to the selected **Bank** and and begin playing on the selected **Layer**.

</div>

**Prism Zero** will save all files to a standard default location `Documents > Avolites > Prism > Zero` unless individually specified within the settings of any **Encoder Element**. The path of this folder can be changed in the **Encoder section** of the **Settings Page**.
