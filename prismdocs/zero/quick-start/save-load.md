When a project is saved in **Prism Zero**, it will contain all application settings throughout the software. This includes all **Playlist** and **Encodelist** settings as well as those found within the applicationâ€™s settings menu.

Loading a previously saved project greatly reduces the setup time for a show and allows the recall of an earlier setup render queue without the need to rebuild it. When a project is loaded, all settings across the application will be updated to those in the save file.

Saved files can be found in the Documents folder under `Avolites > Prism > Zero > Projects`
