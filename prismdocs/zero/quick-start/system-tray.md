Once **Prism Zero** has been started, a **System Tray** icon becomes available.  
By right-clicking on it it is possible to access several features:

- The port which is being used for **Prism Zero** - this is a read-only value, set to 9030.
- The **Open UI** function allows to focus the UI if it's running, or to open a new instance otherwise.
- The **Exit** function allows to fully close **Prism Zero**.
