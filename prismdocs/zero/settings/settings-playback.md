### Playback

Whilst in the **Bank**, it is possible to use the left arrow key to jump back and the right arrow key to jump forwards along the player timeline. The size of this jump is specified in seconds in the **Step Amount** box.

If the **Resume Playback At Start** option is selected, **Prism Zero** will automatically start to play through the existing **Bank** when the application is launched.
