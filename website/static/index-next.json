Change the Y rotation by 90 degrees to enable you to achieve other angles.  ![gimbal](/docs/images/gimbal.jpeg)\\ *Illustration by MathsPoetry*  Press the **Position** button a third time to switch the wheels to Rotation mode. This is similar to Orientation but if you have multiple fixtures selected, the fixtures rotate as a group about the middle fixture.  >It's easier to see what position fixtures are in if you change the tilt angle so they aren't pointing straight down (or up).

    "content": "## Fixtures with Multiple Cells/Sub Fixtures s  If a fixture has multiple cells of control (for example an RGB LED batten) and its personality supports it, you can select and control the fixture either as a whole or as independent cells. This is particularly useful when using Shapes or the Pixel Mapper.  If you select the fixture using the handle it is patched on, all cells of the fixture will be controlled together.  You can use the buttons which appear at the top of the attribute editor window to select the main fixture, or individual cells for control (use the \\[Open Workspace Window\\] softkey to open the Attribute Editor window).  ![Cell Selection](/docs/images/Cell Selection.png)  You can also use \\<Unfold\\> to expand the cells onto individual select buttons. In the Fixtures workspace, the current page of fixtures will be replaced by select buttons for each individual fixture cell. On fader handles, the unfolded fixture cells will start at handle 1.  There are two ways to unfold fixture cells:      Press \\<Unfold\\> then select range of fixtures. The cells will     immediately appear on the handles.      Select fixtures, press \\<Unfold\\>, then press \\[Selected Fixtures\\].     This method allows for non consecutive fixtures to be unfolded.  To go back to normal, press \\<Unfold\\> then \\[Exit Unfold\\].  You can also use the numeric keypad to quickly select cells.

    "content": "## Changing Attributes Using The Wheels s  \"Attributes\" are the functions of the fixture, like pan, tilt, colour, dimmer, etc. You select which attributes you want to modify using the Attribute Bank buttons and set values using the wheels. The attributes available depend on the fixture type. Dimmer channels only have a dimmer attribute.  You can also select attributes by touching the IPCGBES buttons on the touch screen, and modify them using the [Attribute Editor workspace window](../controlling fixtures/using the select buttons and wheels.md#attribute editor window).  On the Pearl Expert the wheels on the Touch Wing are used instead of the wheels on the console, unless you change this using the User Settings.  Each attribute button controls several attributes, one on each wheel. On Sapphire Touch the trackball always controls pan/tilt of the selected fixtures, with the ring controlling fine tilt.  1. With some fixtures selected, press the button for the attribute to be changed  2. Turn the wheels to set the attribute. The display above the wheels shows which attributes are being controlled, and the settings which are available scroll up and down as you turn the wheels.   You can also touch the roller image on the screen to change the attributes up or down by one. For continuously variable controls like a dimmer, touching the roller will set the attribute to full or zero. ![Wheels](/docs/images/Wheels.png)  3. Repeat from 1 to change other attributes of the selected fixtures.  Some other things to know about attributes:      If an attribute is in the programmer, it is highlighted (as shown     with the \"Green\" setting in the screen picture above). This provides     a quick way to see which attributes are in the programmer.      You can also select the attribute to be changed from the softkeys by     pressing the \"Attribute Options\" button.      If the display above the wheels does not show the attribute when you     press the button, that attribute is not available on the selected     fixtures.      If the wheel display shows a small arrow next to the legends, this     means that there are further attributes to control. Press the     Attribute button again to toggle through the attributes.  ![Toggle Attributes](/docs/images/Toggle Attributes.png)      The wheels operate in an \"acceleration\" mode. If you spin the wheel     fast, the fixture changes in larger steps. If you move the wheel     slowly, the fixture moves in its smallest increment.      Holding down the \\<Avo\\> button while turning a wheel puts the wheel     into \"Fast\" mode. When in this mode, a single rotation of the wheel     changes the attribute you are controlling over its full range. For     example, if while moving the Pan wheel you hold down \\<Avo\\> the     fixture will make a complete pan movement between end stops in one     rotation of the wheel.      Some LED colour mixing fixtures have a Virtual Dimmer function     (using the Intensity wheel) which offers intensity control by     mastering the RGB levels when the fixture itself does not provide an     intensity channel.

This is very useful, for example, if you've accidentally left a fixture out of a cue you can copy settings from its neighbour.  You can align multiple fixtures to others in one operation, either using groups or individual selection. If you are aligning different numbers of fixtures there are options to set how this is handled, see below.  1. Select the fixtures you want to Align either manually or using a group.  2. At the top level menu press \\<Fixture Tools\\>/\\<ML Menu\\> then \\[Align Fixtures\\].  3. Set the mask to include the attribute groups you want to copy (using the Attribute Bank buttons, or using the softkey options for exclude and include all attributes).  4. Touch the select button of the fixture or group you want to copy the settings from.  5. Press \\[Align\\]  The fixture selection order is used to determine how the aligned values are copied.      The \\[Auto Reset Mask\\] option will always set the mask to Include     All whenever you enter the Align Fixtures function. The alternative     option \\[Remember Mask\\] will leave the last mask set.      \\[Spread Attributes\\] will try to spread out the attribute changes     if there are a different number of fixtures in the source and target     groups (best for positions). \\[Repeat Attributes\\] will repeat the     source selection on extra fixtures, or attempt to mirror the     fixtures if there are fewer.      \\[Align Programmer Attributes\\] will only align the attributes which     are in the programmer, \\[Align All Attributes\\] will align all the     attributes which are enabled by the mask. So for example if you want     to align the tilt of some fixtures and you have set the tilt you     want on an example fixture, \\[Align Programmer Attributes\\] would     only change the tilt; but \\[Align All Attributes\\] would copy the     pan setting from the source fixture as well.      \\[Palette References Maintained\\] will copy palettes from the source     fixtures. \\[Palette References Lost\\] will convert the palettes to     absolute values in the target fixtures.      If the fixture you are copying the settings from is also one of the     fixtures being aligned, it's difficult to tell what you are doing as     all the fixture buttons light up red.

The first and last fixtures of the range are affected most, and the central fixtures are affected least. The amount of fan can be set using the attribute wheels.  As with shapes, the order in which you select the fixtures sets how the fan effect works. The fixtures you select first and last will be the ones which change most. If you use a group to select the fixtures, the order you selected the fixtures when you recorded the group is used.  The fan effect, while normally used on pan or tilt attributes, can be applied to any attribute.  1. Select the fixtures you want to fan.  2. Press \\<Fan\\>.  3.

This is very useful for complex performances which must be exactly the same time every time, or for unattended operation. Each step in the cue list is assigned a time at which it will run.  The console can have up to 4 separate timecode sources. For each, the timecode can be read from the system clock, from an internal timecode source, from MIDI, SMPTE or from Winamp. Internal timecode is useful for programming a sequence which will later be triggered by an external timecode source.  1. **Connect** the cue list for which you want to set timecode.  2. Press \\[Timecode\\] on the top level menu.  3. Press **softkey A** to select Timecode 1 4, and **softkey B** to select the desired timecode source.  4. Press \\[Record\\].  5.

Press \\[Record\\] when you have finished.  To play back a timecoded cue list, press \\[Connected Cue Lists\\] on the Timecode menu and select the cue list which is to be played. Then press \\[Timer Disabled/Enabled\\] to enable the timecode input.  When you start the timecode source (or press \\[Play\\] if using internal timecode), each cue will fire as the timecode matches its programmed time.  You can edit the timecode for each cue by using **Wheel A** to select the cue, then press \\<Enter\\> and type the new timecode for the cue.  ![Playback View Window showing timecoded cues](/docs/images/Playback View Window showing timecoded cues.png)  While editing a time you can also use **Wheel B** to select multiple cues, and use the softkey options to enter a value to change the time of all the cues (offset, add a fixed time or subtract a fixed time).

This allows you to build a complete show in a single list and is ideal for [theatrical shows](cue lists/theatre programming.md) where the show must be exactly the same each time. Cue lists can also be useful in busked shows, especially on consoles with a small number of playback faders, to offer a number of different looks on one fader.  Cue lists differ from [chases](chases.md) in the way the console handles changes between cues. Cue lists track fixture state from previous cues and will only change the fixture state if you have modified that fixture in the cue; if there are no changes stored for the fixture, it will remain in the same state. [Chases](chases.md) on the other hand would crossfade between cues, fading out all fixtures which have no stored information in the new cue.  You can change the tracking behaviour of cue lists using the [tracking option](cue lists/cue list playback.md#tracking) for each cue: Block, This Cue Only and Solo   see Tracking in the [Cue List Playback](cue lists/cue list playback.md) section).

Entering more digits will set hours, minutes, seconds.  You can delay the fade times between fixtures in a cue so that the cue is applied sequentially to each fixture. This is called **Fixture Overlap** and can create some amazing *\"peel off\"* or *\"roll\"* type effects with no programming at all.

All channels, including intensity channels,     will fade to the settings in the new cue.

The changes will be timed for a \\[Mode 1\\] cue and controlled by     the fader position for a \\[Mode 2\\] cue. This allows you to create a     shape which gets bigger or faster as you push up the fader. ",

This is useful if you want to make a cue which is similar to one you already have, or to build a new cue from various parts of other cues. It's also useful when editing shapes in cues.  There are two modes, **Quick Include** and **Advanced Include**. Quick Include simply reloads the whole cue. Advanced Include allows you to specify which attributes of which fixtures you want to load into the programmer. So, for example, if you have a cue which contains position, colour and gobo information for 8 fixtures, you can use the include function to load only the colour information for 4 of the fixtures into the programmer. You could then Include position information from another cue into the programmer, and build up a new cue using information from several existing cues.

For example, suppose you recorded a cue which had fixtures at a certain position, with the colour set to green.

The HTP levels in the cue will be mastered by the fader level; for     example if you set the fader at 50% then all HTP levels will be 50%     of their programmed values.      LTP channels are triggered as soon as the fader goes above 0%. If a     fade time is programmed the LTP channels will start to fade; if     there is no fade time they will snap to position *(unless the cue is     set to Mode 2 in which case they fade with the fader position; see     the timings section [Fader Modes](cue timing.md#fade modes) for details of modes)*.

You can set playbacks to high **priority** if you do not want them to be     overridden by other playbacks using the same fixtures. For example,     if you have a couple of fixtures acting as a spotlight, but they are     also programmed into some colour washes, you probably want the     spotlight cue to take priority over the colour washes.

There are three ways of saving looks on Titan.  **Cue:** This is a single look. It may contain movement in the form of shapes, and have fade in and fade out times.  **Chase:** This is a timed sequence of cues, often used for an individual effect.  **Cue List:** This is a linked sequence of cues, usually used to store and replay an entire show or an element of a show from a \"go\" button.  [Chases](chases.md) and [Cue Lists](cue lists.md) are covered in more detail in the following chapters.  When a Cue, Chase or Cue List is stored on a control, the control is called a **Playback**. You can store in several places:      On any **fader handle**   the fader controls the intensity of     fixtures (you can make the fader control other things using playback     [Options](cues/playback options.md)). \t  \tOn a **Virtual fader** in the [Virtual faders](running the show/playback controls.md#virtual faders) window on the touchscreen. This works exactly like \ta physical fader.      On a **touch button** in the Playbacks window   you can set whether     the button latches or flashes the cue using [Key Profiles](system settings/key profiles.md)      On a **Macro/Executor button**   again you can use [Key Profiles](system settings/key profiles.md) to     set latch or flash  If you run out of faders to store playbacks, fader wings are available for [all consoles](about the consoles.md) to add more faders.

If the playback is set to have [Speed on Fader](../cues/playback options.md#shape effect speed), the fader will master the speed of all layers in the shape.  When a key frame shape is running in a playback it can behave as Overlay or LTP. A global value for [Shape Behaviour](../system settings/user settings.md#shape behaviour) is in the [User Settings](../system settings/user settings.md), but you can also set the mode in playback [Options](../cues/playback options.md#shape behaviour) for each playback.      In \\[Overlay\\] mode (default) the shape will have control of the     programmed attributes regardless of whatever else you do. For     example if a key frame shape is controlling fixture colour, firing     another playback, recalling palettes or changing colour using the     wheels will have no visible effect. Once the shape is stopped, the     changes you made will become visible. This means that if you want to     you can preset what will happen when you stop the shape.      In \\[LTP\\] mode, changes of the same or higher priority will override     the shape output. For example if your key frame shape is set to     normal priority, firing a playback with normal priority will block     the shape output. Killing the playback will restore the shape     output. Quick Palettes and manual changes (the programmer) have High     priority. Setting the shape priority to **\"Very High\"** would prevent     the programmer taking over (see     [Priority](../cues/playback options.md#priority) in     playback [Options](../cues/playback options.md)).  For details of how Key Frame Shapes behave in Cue Lists, see [Shape Tracking in Cue Lists](../cue lists/creating a cue list.md#shape tracking in cue lists).

This can be useful to see which fixture you are positioning in the layout.  **Position & Angle/Cell Scale:** When set to 'Position & Angle' the wheels move and rotate the fixtures. When set to 'Cell Scale' the wheels change the size of the fixture by spreading out its cells. This is useful to get the correct layout if you have some large fixtures with widely spaced cells and others with cells close together.  **Arrange/Select Only:** When set to **Arrange** you can move fixtures by clicking and dragging on the screen. When set to **Select Only** fixtures are locked in position on the grid and cannot be dragged around. This provides an alternative way of selecting fixtures to edit while preventing accidental movement.  *If you find you suddenly cannot move anything around this is probably the reason!*  For either setting you can still use the wheels to move and rotate the fixtures.  **Wheels Move Full Pixel/Sub Pixel:** Allows you to position fixtures across pixel boundaries when using the wheels. The **Snap** option centres the fixture on the nearest cell.  **Wheels Rotate Individual Fixtures/Selection:** Sets whether individual fixtures rotate, or whether the whole selection rotates.  **Media options:** Shows a sub menu with useful options when you're using Synergy/Ai to play back media on the fixture.

Reduce **Y** until the bar disappears off the top of the grid. (This is in preparation for adding a displacement animation.)  6. Add a **Displacement animation**. By default this will offset the original position by anything up to 30% distance. This is because the default value for **Distance** is set to a maximum of 30% and **Distance Random** is set to 100% meaning it can use any random value between zero and 30%. Similarly **Direction Random** is set to 100% meaning it can offset in any direction.      Temporarily set **Distance Random** to 0%. (This is in order to see     exactly what the displacement is doing.)      Set **Direction Random** to 0 degrees. (In this example we do not require a     random direction.) Now the bar will disappear because it is being     displaced upwards in the default settings.      Set **Direction** to 180 degrees. Click on the compass button four times     to get there quickly.

Return to the **Opacity animation** controls and increase speed until you're happy.   At this point you may decide actually the effect would be better if it was a vertical bar.

A circle shape, for example, applied to the pan and tilt attributes, would cause the fixture to move its beam in a circular pattern around its current position. You can set the size of the circle and the speed of the circle movement.  Shapes are most useful when used with a group of fixtures. You can then choose to either apply the shape identically to all the fixtures, or offset them so that the shape runs along the fixtures creating *\"wave\"* or *\"ballyhoo\"* type effects (called the **Spread** or **Phase** of the shape). This allows you to very quickly create impressive light shows.  In addition to position shapes, there are a large number of other shapes available in Titan. The shapes are defined for a particular attribute such as colour, dimmer, focus and so on.  Titan also has a **Mask FX** function which lets you mask out certain shapes, preventing them from appearing on the lights. For example, if some fixtures are running a Circle shape, and then a playback is fired which has a Position Mask Shape programmed for some of the fixtures, those fixtures will stop running the circle shape. This can be very useful to modify playbacks at showtime.

A range of speed controls allow you to modify how the shapes appear at showtime giving you a whole range of effects from a few basic stored [cues](cues.md).  You can use the conventional  [Shape Generator](effects/shape generator.md) with preset patterns, or the [Key Frame Shape Generator](effects/key frame shapes.md) which allows you to create your own custom patterns.  The [Pixel Mapper](effects/pixel mapper.md) is used to generate animated textures using the colour or intensity of a group of fixtures (often LED battens, starcloths or LED web type fixtures).

This is set on the fixture somehow (by a menu or switches or remotely using RDM). ALIGN\t\t| A means of copying Attribute characteristics from the first Fixture selected to other selected fixtures, resulting in those attributes of the fixtures being aligned to each other. ART NET\t\t| An ethernet based system allowing multiple Universes of DMX to be sent over a network. ATTRIBUTE\t| One function of a Fixture, such as “Colour Wheel” or “Focus”. ATTRIBUTE GROUPS\t| see IPCGBES. AUTOLOAD\t| A Playback which is automatically fired by a Cue in a Cue List. Enables a chase to be fired by a cue list. BACKUPS\t\t| Copies of a show stored to a storage device for safety. BPM\t\t\t| Beats Per Minute. 60 BPM is equivalent to one step per second. BLIND\t\t| When set to Blind mode, changes made on the console do not affect the DMX output. Useful for making programming changes during a show. BUSKING\t\t| Operating the console live (usually for live music) when you do not have a complete show programmed, but instead creating effects as you go along using palettes etc. CELL\t\t| Part of a Fixture which can be controlled separately within the larger fixture – for example an LED batten may have 12 cells each of which can be controlled separately, or all together. Also called Subfixture. CHANNEL\t\t| Button allowing syntax / numeric style entry and operation of the console using the User Number of fixtures/dimmers. CHASE\t\t| A sequence of one or more pre recorded steps which automatically run one after the other. COLOUR MIX / CMY\t| A system of three filters (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) that can each crossfade from white to a colour, or one colour to another. It is a feature of most Fixtures, which enables any colour to be created. CONNECTED CHASE\t| A Chase which is linked to the Wheels by pressing the <Connect> button. CUE\t\t\t| A single stage look programmed onto a Playback button or fader, or as part of a Cue List. Also known as MEMORY, STATE, SCENE, LOOK. CUE LIST\t| A sequence of cues programmed onto a Playback button or fader. Each cue can have its own delay and fade times and can also start other cues or playbacks. Also known as a CUE STACK or STACK. CUE MODE\t| A playback format programmed into a Cue which determines how the cue fades in and out. There are Cue Modes 0   3. CURVE\t\t| A curve sets how fades and other changes on the console progress over time. A variety of different curves may be selected. DEVICE\t\t| See FIXTURE. DIMMER\t\t| Device used to control the intensity of an individual light. DMX\tDMX512(1990) | a specification for communication between control desks and Fixtures, Originally for Dimmers it has been adopted as a control protocol for most Intelligent Fixtures. It can carry 512 different slots or channels of data per Universe, and Titan can output up to 64 universes (using additional network processors). EXCHANGE\t| A way to swap a Fixture in a show to a different type of fixture while retaining most or all of the programming. FADE\t\t| A continuous transition from one level to another. FAN\t\t\t| A way of automatically spreading out Attributes around a central point to speed up programming. FIXTURE\t\t| Any lighting instrument that is patched using a Personality. Generally refers to a moving light or colour changing light, not an individual Dimmer channel. Also called Intelligent Fixture, Device, Instrument, Moving Light. FIXTURE LAYOUT\t| A way of telling the console where Fixtures are physically located in 2D space, for use with Shapes or the Pixel Mapper. FLASH\t\t| Pushbutton which adds a playback into the existing output of the console. Historically called the ADD button. See also SWOP. FLIP\t\t| A function for use with Moving Head Fixtures. They have two possible Pan and Tilt settings for each position on stage by reversing the yoke, and FLIP will alternate between them. FOCUS\t\t| The library of stored positions, colours etc which are called Focuses on some consoles, are called Palettes on Titan. See PALETTE. This term may also be used in connection with moving fixtures to focus (set the sharpness) of a gobo projection. FX\t\t\t| Refers to effects created with the Shape Generator. GENERIC\t\t| Refers to a lighting instrument which only has a dimmer/intensity control. See also FIXTURE. GROUP\t\t| A Group is a pre programmed collection of Fixtures that can be selected with a single button press. Playback groups can also be created where only one playback in the group can be active at any time. HALO\t\t| A special colour shown around the rim of a touch button, used to quickly identify different types of button. HANDLE\t\t| A control on the console where you can store things – may just be a programmable button, or may have a fader with one or more associated buttons. HTP\t\t\t| Highest Takes Precedence, a mechanism for determining the output level of an attribute (nearly always Intensity) being controlled by more than one Playback. The playback outputting the highest value at any given time will determine the level of the attribute. Also see LTP. HUD\t\t\t| Heads up display, an information window shown on the screen. INCLUDE\t\t| A means of transferring the contents of a Cue or Chase step back into the Programmer for further editing or programming. IPCGBESFX\t| The Attribute groups, used by the console to conveniently group together similar attributes – stands for Intensity, Position, Colour, Gobo, Beam, Effect, Special, FX (shapes). For example the P(osition) group includes Pan and Tilt attributes. KEY FRAME SHAPE\t| A self programmed Shape where you program a set of steps which can then be spread in different ways over a set of fixtures. KEY PROFILE\t| User setting which can be used to change the function of each type of button on the console. LED\t\t\t| Light Emitting Diode, the source of light in many fixtures. May also refers to the small lights within the buttons on the console. LEGEND\t\t| The text or image used to name a handle so you know what you stored in it. LINK\t\t| Connection between cues in a Cue List or Chase enabling them to run on from one to another automatically. LOCATE\t\t| Button which places selected fixtures into a default “ready” state – usually a central position with full intensity, no colour, no gobo, ready for programming. LOCK\t\t| Handles can be Locked so that when you change to a different page, those handles do not change. The lock can be Transparent meaning that it is only locked if the new page doesn’t have any programming on that handle. May also refer to the system for locking the console while left unattended. LTP\t\t\t| Latest Takes Precedence, a mechanism for passing control of an attribute from one Playback to another on the basis that the latest playback changes take over control. Usually used for all attribute types except Intensity. Also see HTP. MACRO\t\t| Has two meanings in Titan. May refer to a stored sequence of button presses which allow you to recreate a complex sequence of operations from a single button. Or may refer to functions programmed into a Fixture by the manufacturer for example to lamp On/Off a fixture or reset the motors – using  DMX command sequences defined within the Personality. MASTER\t\t| Fader or knob giving overall control of a number of different playbacks or attributes. Different types of Masters can be configured on the console. MEMORY\t\t| The name for a Cue or playback on other consoles. MIDI\t\t| A control system used for sending commands between equipment. Stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and originally for sending musical notes between keyboards/synths, it is now used for controlling  and linking many types of equipment. MENU\t\t| List of available functions on the Softkeys. MENU LATCH\t| Holds the current menu active – normally a menu would close when the action is completed. ML MENU\t\t| Provides additional functions for control of moving lights such as lamp on/off and other control functions. MOVE IN DARK (MID)\t| Function of Cue List to pre position a fixture while it is turned off so that it is correctly positioned for the next cue. Called “Mark” on other consoles.  ON and OFF\t| Any Attribute stored in a Playback can be On or Off. An attribute which is ON is changed by the playback when it is fired. An attribute which is OFF is stored in the playback for future re use but has no effect when the playback is fired. OVERLAP\t\t| Sets how the console allocates new values to a group of Fixtures. 100% means that all fixtures are updated simultaneously. 0% means that the fixtures will be updated one after the other. PAGE\t\t| To provide more Handles for programming, you can change to a different Page. You can Lock handles so that they do not change when you change the page. PALETTE\t\t| A term used to describe a referenced pre defined state for an Attribute that can be recalled whenever required during programming. Each Fixture may be set to a different value in the Palette, the entries can be named, and recalled with a single button press. Called Focus by some other console manufacturers. PARK\t\t| A Parked fixture is one which is patched to a handle but has no DMX Address set. This happens to a fixture when its DMX address is taken by another fixture during a later patching session; the fixture retains programming information and the Repatch function can be used to give it a new DMX address. Not the same as the “Park channel” function used to set a channel to a fixed value as found on other consoles. PATCH\t\t| Set up of a show on the console, telling the console what fixtures are being used, what mode they are in, and what DMX address they are set to. PERSONALITY | A description of what Attributes a particular Fixture has and how the console will patch and use these. It also determines which Wheel will control which attribute.  PIXEL MAPPER\t| Allows you to tell the console where fixtures are located in 2D space, and then to display patterns or media across those fixtures. PLAYBACK\t| A programmed Cue, Chase or Cue List, stored on a Handle (button, touch button or fader). PRELOAD\t\t| A playback button which sets the LTP channels in a cue but not the HTP channels. Used to pre position fixtures before firing a cue. Also a cue list function which allows one cue to preload the LTP channels in another cue. PRESET FOCUS\t| The old name for Palettes on previous Avolites consoles and other consoles. See PALETTE. PROGRAMMER\t| The part of the console which contains Attribute information which has been changed by the user, prior to recording. QUICK PALETTE\t| If you press a palette button with no fixtures selected, the console will apply the palette to all fixtures it has programming for. This is called a Quick Palette. RANGE\t\t| If an Attribute on a fixture is split into certain zones for different effects, for example if the fixture can snap to 8 gobos selected by DMX values 1 32, 33 64, 65 96 etc then the attribute is said to have Ranges. RDM\t\t\t| Remote Device Management, a way of configuring fixtures remotely from the console. Not all fixtures support this. RELEASE\t\t| How a Playback leaves the LTP channels it was controlling when it is killed. Normally the LTP channels just remain in their last state, but you can use the Release settings to get them to revert to a previous state. RGB / RGBW\t| A system of colour mixing using LED emitters of different colours. Often more emitter colours are provided in the fixture to allow better colour rendering or mixing of pale tints. Possible colours include Red, Green, Blue, White, Amber, Lime, Cyan, UV   so you may see RGBAL fixtures or RGBAWUV. sACN\t\t| An ethernet based system allowing multiple universes of DMX to be sent over a network. SELECT BUTTON\t| Blue button used to select a Handle when programming. SELECTED\t| A Fixture that is under manual control. SEQUENCE\t| Another name for a Chase on other consoles. SHAPE \t\t| A preprogrammed effect available which is applied to an Attribute. It can then be customised and stored in a cue. SHARED PALETTE\t| A Palette in which information is only stored for one Fixture, but is available to all fixtures of that type. SOFTKEY\t\t| Menu buttons marked A J down the side of the screen, which have different functions as shown on the adjacent part of the screen depending on the currently active menu. SPREAD\t\t| How a shape or effect is output across a group of fixtures – if zero, all fixtures operate in synchronisation. Also called Phase. STACK\t\t| Another name for a Cue List. SUBFIXTURE\t| See Cell. SWOP\t\t| Type of flash button which turns on the output being flashed and turns off all other output while the button is pressed. Sometimes called “Solo”. Also used for selecting fixtures or playbacks when programming. See also FLASH. TIMECODE\t| An electronic timer signal which allows cue list playback to be synchronised to a soundtrack or other events. TIMES\t\t| Many elements of programming can be timed to create effects, these together are referred to as Times. TNP\t\t\t| Titan Network Processor, a rackmount unit to handle the processing of additional DMX Universes or to operate automatic shows. TRACKING\t| Describes the operation of Cue Lists where attribute states follow through from previous cues unless changed by the user. TRIGGER POINT\t| The level set in the User Settings which determines at which point a Playback fader triggers the LTP channels programmed onto it. UNFOLD\t\t| A function that allows Chase steps to be laid out onto the playback faders for easy editing. UNIVERSE\t| A full set of 512 DMX control channels/slots. Titan consoles can create up to 64 universes, 16 on the console and the rest remotely using network processing. UPS\t\t\t| Uninterruptible Power Supply, fitted internally in some consoles, to keep the console running in case of power failure. USER NUMBER\t| Each fixture / dimmer has a User Number which allows you to select them using the numeric keypad and <Through> button, as commonly used on other types of console. USER SETTINGS\t| User definable desk settings. To change them, hold down the Avo button and select [User Settings]. VIRTUAL DIMMER\t| Used with LED colour mixing fixtures, these add an intensity function to the fixture which masters the RGB controls on the fixture when it does not actually have an intensity control channel. VISUALISER\t| Software providing a lifelike 3D view of the stage and lighting, allowing virtual programming. WING\t\t| An additional panel of faders or buttons which can be connected to the console to expand the number of Handles available. WIPEALL\t\t| A process which clears the current show, providing a clean start. Does not affect previously saved shows.

This manual aims to you tell you everything there is to know about operating your Avolites console (that's quite a lot).  If you're already familiar with using lighting consoles but new to Titan,  the [Quick Start](./quick start.md) section tells you how to do the most common things.  After that we try to take you through all the things you will need to know in the order that you're most likely to need them, so we start with how to [connect up the console](./titan basics.md), then look at [patching lights](./patching.md). After that we go through [how to control](./controlling fixtures.md) the different attributes of the lights, then how to store frequently used settings in [palettes](./palettes.md). Titan has some great built in [effects](./effects.md), so we look at those, then how to build a show by recording [cues](./cues.md), [chases](./chases.md) and [cue lists](./cue lists.md). Later there are sections on [Capture Visualiser](./capture visualiser.md),  the video integration system [Synergy](./synergy.md), help when [running a show](./running the show.md), [remote control](./remote control.md) of the console from a phone or tablet, and [system settings](./system settings.md) to configure how the console works.   Finally we end up with a [glossary](./glossary.md) which covers some of the lighting terms which get used in this manual, and also explains some of the terms which mean different things on other brands of console.  If you're reading the online version of this manual you can use the search box top right to look for particular terms, or read the chapters in sequence using the left sidebar.  Happy programming! ",

One of the most widely supported is Art Net.  Art Net is not specific to one range of products, and is recognised and implemented by a growing number of manufacturers. Many products (such as Dimmers and Moving lights) can accept the Art Net signal directly, so there is no need to convert the signal to DMX. Most people will, however, need to output DMX to their equipment and this can be done using an Art Net to DMX converter.  In the following diagram, an Art Net compliant Console (such as a Titan console) is connected via a network hub to an Art Net compatible dimmer and 2 DMX conversion boxes.  ![Art Net Explanation general](/docs/images/Art Net Explanation general.jpeg)  Once the system is connected together, the different outputs (or Nodes) can be configured.      The dimmer is given the start address of 200      The 1st DMX box is set to universe 1 and universe 2      The 2nd DMX box is also set to universe 1 and universe 2  The console is then used to set the DMX lines to the Art Net nodes.  It is important to remember:      Each Art Net to DMX box (or compatible Dimmer, or compatible moving     light) is a device,      Each device may have one or more nodes(i.e. the Art Net to DMX box     has 2 nodes, these are the 2 DMX outputs; the dimmer itself is a     node),      Each node can be set to a Universe (1 256). This universe is     equivalent to a 512 channel DMX line  You can then specify which console line is assigned to each node. A console line can be assigned to multiple nodes (this will duplicate the DMX universe), but each node should have only one console line assigned to it.  Here, the console assigns the following:      Line A to Box 1 universe 1 and box 2 universe 1      Line B to Box 1 universe 2      Line C to Box 2 universe 2 and the dimmer rack  ![Art Net Explanation Nodes to DMX](/docs/images/Art Net Explanation Nodes to DMX.jpeg) ",

If you are using a hub/switch as shown above, use straight through     patch cables. If you are directly connecting the console to another     Ethernet device you need to use crossover cables.  Set the Net Lynx box as follows:      Subnet Mask = 0      DMX A Universe = 1      DMX B Universe = 2  A lot of Art Net devices, including the Net Lynx box, are set to IP address 2.x.x.x as default, and can be set to 10.x.x.x using an option jumper, so you should check what the setting of your device is.  If your Art Net devices need to be set to a non standard IP address, then in steps 1 and 2 you need to use Windows Control Panel to set the console to that address range instead of 2.x.x.x  With everything connected, start the console.  1. Ensure the console has an IP in the 2.x.x.x range as described at the start of the chapter.  2. Switch the console to System and select \\[DMX Settings\\].  3. The DMX Settings window should open.  4. Select the Art Net module from the node list in the left hand side of the window.  5. Press the small 'i' button to show the node properties. Ensure that the correct Network adapter is set (this may not be the Default Adapter)  6. If you wish to turn off the Art Net output, you can unselect the \\\"Enable DMX output\\\" option. This will stop the Console from outputting Art Net on any Lines.  7. Art Net normally only sends Data when it is changed, rather than a continuous stream. There are times when it is preferable to send Art Net all the time. to do this, select the \\\"Continuous Art Net Data Stream\\\" option.  8. The \\\"Always broadcast Art Net\\\" option enables you to send Art Net to the entire network, rather than a specific IP address.  9. Press the blue → arrow on the Art Net node to connect it to a DMX output line.  10. Select a console DMX line from the right hand side of the window.  11. The DMX line will now be outputting over the selected Art Net node.  12. Click 'i' on the node you have added to make sure the properties are correct. (Problems can be caused if you attach multiple DMX lines to a single node.)  13. Make sure that the Universe is set to 1 for Line 1, and 2 for Line 2.   Art Net uses a subnet mask with its universe. For Titan purposes:   Titan universes 1   16 are subnet mask = 0, Art Net universes = 1    16  14. You can close the DMX settings window.  The console should now be working correctly.  To remove a node from a DMX line, select the node and click the blue X button.  \\\"Unpolled\\\" and \\\"unknown\\\" devices may appear as Art Net nodes.      An unpolled device is a \\'rolling extra\\' which allows more than 4     connections to be made to a particular Art Net device. The Art Net     specification only allows each device to advertise a max of 4     universes so if you need to add more the console has to invent the     5th, 6th, etc universes.

The console helps you with this by providing separate windows for **Colour** palettes, **Position** palettes, and **Gobo/Beam** palettes.  When you store a palette, it will only contain what's in the programmer (the attributes you have changed since you last pressed \\<Clear\\>). For example to create a colour palette you would just set the colour, and not change any other attribute. You can also make palettes which contain effects such as shapes and pixel mapping. If fade or delay times are programmed for fixtures or attributes, these will also be stored in the palette, and you can also create [palettes which contain only time information](#creating a time palette).  If the programmer contains more than one attribute, you can set a mask to restrict which fixture attributes will be stored in the palette.  Palette information may be **Global**, **Shared** or **Normal**:    **Global** palettes work on any type of fixture   **Shared** palettes apply the same value to all fixtures of the same type   *for example when setting colours, the \"Red\" palette would set the same colour values for \"Red\" to all MAC 2000 fixtures*   **Normal** palettes are used when each fixture requires its own value   *for example when programming positions, each fixture will have a different setting*  It is possible, by merging information into palettes, to create a palette which contains global, shared and normal attributes.  Available attributes for Global palettes are Dimmer, Pan, Tilt and Colour. When creating a global palette for a colour mixing fixture, both CMY and RGB attributes are calculated and a special \"dynamic\" value is added to colour wheel channels, the console will attempt to match the closest fixed colour wheel colour to the selected mix colour.  There is a [User Setting \"Minimum Palette Mode\"](../system settings/user settings.md#minimum palette mode) which can force the console to record palettes in **Shared** or **Normal** mode. ",

If the palette windows are not shown then press the **Groups and Palettes** workspace button.  1. Press \\<Clear\\> to clear the programmer  2. Select the fixtures for which you want to store palette values  3. Using the attribute buttons and wheels, set the attributes you want in the palette entry\\ *You can store any or all attributes of a fixture in each palette entry*  4. Press \\<Record\\> then \\<Palette\\> (or \\<Palette\\> then \\[Record Palette\\])\\ *Using [Quick Record](#quick record) you can skip this step and the palette mask is set automatically to match the window.*  5. If you wish, set the palette mask   this sets which attributes will be recorded in the palette. Select attributes using the Attribute Bank buttons   anything lit up will be saved. \\[Set Mask\\] and \\[Record by\\] softkeys also control the Mask (see below).  6. Touch a button in one of the palette windows to store the palette (if you touch a used button you will be given further options). Or enter a palette number and press \\[Store\\]           If you want to record to a physical button, press \\<Record\\> then     \\<Palette\\>. All buttons where you can store the palette will then     flash, press one to store.  ![Recording a Palette menu](/docs/images/Recording a Palette menu.png)      The console will automatically set the palette as Global, Shared or     Normal (by checking if the values to be stored are the same across     all fixtures of the same type). You can override the setting by     pressing \\[softkey C\\]. See below for more details of how this automatic     choice works.      \\[Set Mask\\] allows you to specify which attribute groups will be     included in the palette. You can also use the grey Attribute Bank     buttons on the right hand edge of the console to set the mask.\\     An attribute group is included when the softkey is inverted (like     the Colour group in the picture) and when the LED is lit on the     Attribute Bank button. If you use **[Quick Record](#quick record)**     the mask is automatically set by the workspace window you     save the palette in   Positions only includes P, Colours only C and     Beams includes IGBES. If you use the \\<Record\\> button then you need     to set the mask manually.      Press the **Attribute Options** button to toggle each mask group between     Include and Exclude.  ![Setting a mask for recording a palette](/docs/images/Setting a mask for recording a palette.png)      \\[Record By...\\] allows you to control how the mask is used when     saving the palette. The options are:         \\[Channel in programmer\\] records only channels which are in the     programmer (ones which you have changed)          \\[Group in programmer\\] records all channels in any attribute group     which has one or more channels in the programmer. *For example if     Cyan is in the programmer, all colour channel settings will be     recorded even if not in the programmer.*         \\[Group in mask\\] records everything included by the mask set on the     attribute buttons         \\[Mixed\\] records by attribute group for **Position** and **Colour** but by     channel for all other controls.      The console will automatically create a legend for your palette     (unless the     [User Setting \\[Auto Legend\\]](../system settings/user settings.md#auto legend)     is set to Off). For colour     palettes a coloured icon is used to show the selected colour. If the     palette contains fixtures set to different colours, a coloured bar     will be shown for each. For CITP (media server) palettes, the media     thumbnail will be used. For other attributes the last adjusted     function value will be used for the legend, except for pan and tilt     which will use a default legend.\\     ![Automatic Legends set for Colour Palettes](/docs/images/Automatic Legends set for Colour Palettes.png)      You can also manually set a legend for the palette while you are     saving it using \\[Provide a legend\\]. See     [Setting Legends for Palettes](#setting legends for palettes).      If you select a Palette button which is already used, the console     offers you options to \\[Cancel\\], \\[Replace\\], \\[Merge\\] or \\[Quick     Merge\\] the existing palette.       \\[Replace\\] will erase the palette and save only the latest changes         you have made       \\[Merge\\] will combine your changes with the palette       \\[Quick Merge\\] will merge only the     attributes which are currently stored in the palette   the button     shows you which attributes.      This allows you to add settings for additional types of fixtures to     a shared palette or to update the existing fixture settings.     Pressing the palette button again will automatically merge using     Quick Merge.      The console will select **Global** mode if the programmer contains the     same values for all selected fixtures and one or more of the     attributes is suitable for Global. If the values are the same but     none of the attributes are suitable for Global the console will     select Shared. If some attributes are suitable and some aren't, the     console will record the suitable ones as Global and the others as     Shared. If the values are different the console will select Normal.     You can prevent the console from using Global and/or Shared modes     using the **[Minimum Palette Mode](../system settings/user settings.md#minimum palette mode)**     option in the [Palettes tab](../system settings/user settings.md#palettes) of     [User Settings](../system settings/user settings.md).

This is very useful for touring shows and venues with a high turnover of events.  Fixture Exchange works best if you use Palettes to create your cues. This allows you to adjust for position differences and so on by reprogramming a few position palettes, rather than having to reprogram every cue. Cues recorded with absolute values will need to be re recorded, preferably using palettes.  The pan, tilt and dimmer will always be preserved from one fixture type to the next. For other attributes, the console will attempt to match the functions between the fixtures, but you can change the details of this using the Exchange Mapping function (see [next section](./changing the patch.md#exchange mapping)). All programmed items including palettes will be preserved, so the programming can be easily adjusted by updating your palettes as normal.  Fixture exchange also gives you a powerful way to re use an existing show with new lights, so you can give yourself a programming head start when faced with a new fixture.      It's a good idea to save your show before performing major changes     such as fixture exchange. Should you change your mind or have     problems, you will easily be able to return your show to its     previous state.  1. Enter patch mode by pressing \\<Patch\\>.  2.

Press the     \\[Exchange Fixture\\] option.  5. Repeat from step 3 to exchange other fixtures with the same type     of new fixture.  > After exchanging fixtures you need to update the palettes which used those fixtures.

However, this may not always work out quite right, so using Exchange Mapping you can manually map functions between the fixtures. For example this allows you to map the old gobos to similar new gobos even if they are not in the same wheel position, and to ensure that rotation speeds work the same.  Any changes made will apply immediately to the show. Mappings are remembered and will be used whenever you exchange the same fixtures in the future (though you can restore to factory mappings at any time should you need to using the \\[Clear All Mappings\\] softkey).  ![exchange mapping](/docs/images/exchange mapping.png)  To set up mapping:  1. Press \\<View/Open\\> then Patch to show the Patch View screen.  2. Select the Exchange Mapping tab.  3.

The mapped attribute on both fixtures will highlight in light blue. Brown controls are not mapped. The centre of the view shows the individual functions of the selected attribute, and coloured lines show how these map between the fixtures.  6. To map a function, click on a source function then a destination function. Any previous mapping will be removed. You can map multiple source functions to a single destination function.  7. To unmap a function, double click the source function. If there are multiple sources mapped, double click the destination function.  8. To move a mapping, click the existing destination, then click the new destination.      Where a fixture has been exchanged from more than one source fixture     you can switch between them by selecting the relevant source fixture     under the \\'exchanged from\\' column.      When you change the mapping, the \\'Unsaved Changes\\' options will     pop up at the bottom of the screen.

Where multiple source functions are mapped to a single destination function with a range, separate destination buttons are shown allowing you to set a different destination range for each source function.  To set the range, first select a destination function, then click the Edit Ranges option at the bottom of the window. Then select the function whose range you wish to change. (Note that it is only possible to adjust the range of a mapped function. Any functions that are not mapped or are not ranges will grey out). You can then adjust the maximum and minimum values for the range either by wheel, by touching the wheel view on touch consoles or by selecting the relevant softkey and entering the value.

Fixture copying is very useful if you need an additional fixture of a type you've already patched and programmed because the new copy will come complete with all the cues and palettes of the original fixture you've copied. The copied fixture will be \"Parked\" (have no DMX channel allocated) so you will need to set an address before you can use it (see [changing the patch section](./changing the patch.md))  Move is useful for tidying up the console.  1. Press the \\<Copy\\> button.  2. Select \\[Copy\\] or \\[Move\\]. Pressing the \\<Copy\\> button again will also toggle through these options.  3. Press the Select button of the fixture you want to copy/move. You can select multiple fixtures    use the \\<Thro\\> and \\<And\\> buttons to add more fixtures to the selection.  4. Press the empty Select button where you want it to go.      The \\<Menu Latch\\> button latches the Copy/Move/Link menu, so you     can keep copying or moving things without having to keep pressing     the Copy/Move/Link button. Press again to unlatch.      The \\[Retain Layout\\] or \\[Bunch Up\\] option is used when copying a     group of fixtures with empty handles in the group   you can either     keep the empty handles, or bunch up the used handles together. There     is also a \\[Bunch Up With Offset\\] option which allows you to leave     a gap in the DMX channels, if you are running a show where you need     to exchange fixtures to ones which use more DMX channels.      When in Copy mode, option \\[Copy Legends\\] can be changed to \\[Don't     copy legends\\] so that the copied fixtures are given default     legends.      When in Move mode, \\[Swap Items if Required\\] will attempt to     reposition any existing handles which are in the way of the move.     This is useful when rearranging buttons on a page which is nearly     full. ",

Avolites consoles use a \"personality\" system to control fixtures. This means you don't have to know how each fixture works, you just tell Titan what you want to do and it will send the right control commands. The console has built in personalities for most types of fixture, which tell it what attributes are available and how to control them. If the console does not have the personality for your fixture, you can download further personalities from the Avolites website, create your own using the Personality Builder application installed on the console, or Avolites can create one for you. See the [personalities section](../fixture personalities.md) for details of how to find personalities.  You can patch either using the Patch menu (described below) or the [Patch View](./changing the patch.md#patch view) window.  1. Press \\<Patch\\>.  2. Press \\[Fixtures\\]. ![Patch Menu](/docs/images/Patch Menu.png)  3. Select the correct fixture manufacturer from the softkeys (\\[Previous\\] and \\[Next\\] page through the list of manufacturers). Or use Quick Search and type the first few letters of the manufacturer's name on the keyboard to find the one you want.  4. Select correct fixture from the softkeys (F and G show other pages). You can use Quick Search here as well.  5. Select the correct fixture operating mode from the softkeys.  6. \\[Address =\\] shows the first free DMX address. Type the new address on the numeric keypad if you want a different one. \\[DMX line=xx\\] lets you patch to a different DMX line, or you can enter the address as \\[line\\].\\[address\\], e.g. 2.45 would set address 45 on line 2. ![Address Input](/docs/images/Address Input.png)  7. Patch the fixture by pressing a Fixture touch button, a Macro/Executor button or the blue Select button of a fader handle (not the main playback faders).  8. A fixture touch button turns dark blue and shows fixture details when it is patched. If you patch to a fader handle the select button will light up dimly.  9. Repeat from 7 to patch more of the same fixture type. The DMX address automatically updates so you can just keep patching by pressing Select buttons.      To patch multiples of the same fixture, use the \\[Quantity\\] option.     Or you can run your finger or draw a selection box round the touch     buttons, or for physical buttons hold down the first button in the     range and press the last button in the range. The fixtures will be     patched to sequential blocks of DMX addresses.      \\[Options\\], \\[Offset\\] allows you to leave gaps in the DMX channels     between fixtures when patching multiple fixtures, which is useful if     you are planning a show which may involve exchanging fixtures. The     Offset number is the size of the block which will be allocated to     the fixture, for example if you want to allow 32 channels for each     fixture you would set Offset to 32.      You cannot patch more than one fixture onto a handle. If the handle     is already used, the patch will fail.      If you are patching a fixture which uses a separate dimmer channel,     such as a VL5, you can patch the dimmer channel onto the same handle     as the moving light part of the fixture so you can control it all     together. This is called a Pending Dimmer (in the [Patch View](./changing the patch.md#patch view) window     this is indicated with a flash symbol behind the user number).      \\[Options\\], \\[Preset Palettes\\] sets whether the console will     create default colour, gobo and position palettes for the new     fixture. These are created in the Position, Colour and Beam     workspace windows.. This option is turned off by default but can     give you a useful starting point.      \\[Options\\], \\[AutoGroups\\] sets whether the console will     automatically create groups from the fixtures you patch. If Enabled,     a group is created for all fixtures of the same type, and another if     you patch a quantity of fixtures.      To show the DMX address for fixtures, press \\<View/Open\\> then     \\<Patch\\>. To show patch details for a single fixture press     \\<View/Open\\> then the fixture select button. On touch buttons the     DMX address is displayed on the top right of the button in the     format {DMX line}.{Address} (this display can be disabled using the     context menu).      If a patch goes over the capacity of a DMX line, the console will     patch at the beginning of the next line. For example if you try to     patch a moving head fixture at channel 1.510, it will actually be     patched at 2.1.      The console will show a picture of the fixture you select in the     prompt area to help you check you have got the right one (if     provided in the fixture personality; some fixtures do not include     this information)\\     ![Fixture Mode](/docs/images/Fixture Mode.png) ",

You need to set up the network settings on the Wireless Access Point, the mobile device and the console so that they can communicate with each other. In this example we use an Android smartphone but other devices are similar.  1. In the access point's admin screen, give the access point an IP address such as `10.0.0.1`, make sure wireless is switched on and enable the DHCP server.

The Pioneer equipment has some limitations with its network IP address   it either needs to be assigned an address using DHCP or it uses an automatic address in the range 169.254.\\*.\\*   which means that if you are already using networking to control the lights (ArtNet or sACN) things can get a bit complicated as many lighting products cannot use that address range.  **Pioneer Bridge running on the console**  If you aren’t using networking, or your console has two network interfaces, or you can adjust your lighting to a suitable address range, then you can run the Pioneer Bridge software on the console itself. If your console includes an ethernet switch, you can connect the “Extension” ethernet socket on the Pioneer equipment directly to the console, otherwise you need to go through an external switch.  Run the Pro DJ Link Bridge software from the Tools \\> Additional Programs menu on the console.    You can set the Bridge software to run automatically when the console powers up using the Tools \\> Control Panel \\> Run on Startup menu option. This is useful in club environments where the console is always linked.  ![Pro DJ link bridge command on shell menu](/docs/images/Pro DJ link bridge command on shell menu 2.png)  Look at the Interface tab of the bridge software to see what IP address is being used by the Pioneer equipment. You need to set the network interface on the console to use an IP address in the same range – if it is using DHCP, just set the console to DHCP as well, or if using the automatic addresses set a fixed address. For example if the bridge is set to 169.254.225.212 as in the image below, set the console to 169.254.225.1 (assuming nothing else on the network is using that address).  ![Pro DJ link bridge command on shell menu](/docs/images/Pro DJ link bridge command on shell menu.png)    Once you have everything connected up and have got all the IP addresses right, the bridge software should show connections for both the Titan console and the DJ mixer.   Some ArtNet / sACN equipment can be configured to run on the 169.254.\\*.\\* address range, in which case you can run everything on the same network.  **Pioneer Bridge running on separate computer**  If you need to keep the Pioneer network separate to the lighting network and your console only has a single network port, or if you just prefer to have the bridge separate from the console, then you can download the bridge software from the Pioneer website and run it on a separate computer. If you need two separate address ranges then your computer will need two network interfaces. Once you have everything connected up and have got all the IP addresses right, the bridge software should show connections for both the Titan console and the DJ mixer. ",

When a fade time is entered on the numeric keypad, you can also change the Fixture Overlap using the \\[Overlap\\] softkey.

The palette fade time remains active while the Palette Fade menu is open. Press \\<Exit\\> to leave the menu and return to instant palette recall.  If you apply a palette as a \"Quick Palette\" (i.e. without selecting any fixtures) then it will be overridden by the next cue (so if you fade to green using a Quick Palette, then fire a cue which sets those fixtures blue, they will go blue). If you apply a palette after selecting fixtures, it will go into the programmer and override any subsequent cues until you press \\<Clear\\>.  When programming your palettes, group all the colour palettes in one area of the console, position palettes in another area, and so on. This helps you to find them when the show is running and the pressure is on.  If you are lighting a band, make position palettes for every person on stage so you can spotlight them for those unplanned solos.  You can use the [Off](../controlling fixtures/using the select buttons and wheels.md#clearing attributes using off) function when programming to set some cues to only affect position, and other cues to set colours, gobos, add shapes, and so on. By combining two or more cues you can produce a much wider range of effects than if all your cues set all the attributes. However, for this to work well you need to make sure you know what attribute is going to be affected by each cue; as if you fire two \"colour only\" cues then nothing is go",

You can always download the latest version of the software from the Avolites website: http://www.avolites.com.   > From v10 it is possible to keep the older versions of Titan installed on a console when you install a new version, which is useful for backwards compatibility if you need to load a show created in an older version. To swap between versions go to Switch Software on the Tools menu.           The Titan Mobile, Titan Go and Editor/Simulator software is     installed simply by running the \"PC Suite\" installer program as with     any other Windows application. Please ensure you have exited the     Titan software before running the installer.      If you are upgrading the software from a version earlier than v12,     you will have to obtain an AvoKey USB dongle from Avolites and     license the software. See the [Software Licensing](recovering reinstalling the console.md#software licensing) section for details of how to do     this.       Software upgrades for consoles are installed from a USB pen drive.  Having downloaded a new version of software, copy it to the USB drive and install it on the console like this:  1. Copy the installer file to a USB drive and insert into the console.  2. In the screen **tools menu**, stop the console software using the **Shutdown Software** button at the bottom of the list. ![Tools Menu](/docs/images/Tools Menu.png)  3. Open the **tools menu** again, touch the **Folders** icon and navigate to the drive where the upgrade file is found.  4. Run the installer by double clicking/double tapping.  5. When the installation has completed, shut down the console and restart it. This will allow any operating system updates to install.",

This is also how you connect TitanNet processors to expand DMX outputs.  > All consoles to be linked must be running the same version of Titan for this to work.

Unavailable consoles are shown with a red background.  Initially all consoles are \"Master\" consoles. If you connect to a session on another console as multi user you become a \"Slave\" on that console. The show on the Master is transferred across the network to the Slave. On the Slave you can choose to save the show locally or to save changes back to the Master console.  The toolbar will show details of the master/slave status. Console legends can be changed in the System menu using the \\[Console Legend\\] option.  ![Shell Slave](/docs/images/Shell Slave.png)  Consoles connected in a multi user session work on the same show. If the same handle worlds are selected then an action on one console is mirrored across them all, for example firing a cue on the slave console will also fire the cue on the master. If the master has motorised faders, the fader will move; if not, fader levels must match before they can take over. If different handle worlds are selected, users can work independently on their own pool of handles.  In all situations the master console outputs DMX and channels in a remote programmer are shown with a blue dot on the touch wheel views. If two or more consoles are editing the same fixture, the last console to change any attribute will take over control of the fixture.  Slaves can leave a session using the \\[Leave Session\\] button in the Sessions View or in the TitanNet menu. The console will restore the local show it had loaded prior to joining. Master consoles have the option to \\[Terminate Session\\].  If a console is running as [backup](../running the show/linking consoles for multi user or backup.md#setting up consoles for backup), it has options to \\[Takeover\\], \\[Sync now\\] and \\[Leave Session\\]. If \\[Takeover\\] is selected, the console will immediately become the master and take over DMX output with the chosen user and handle worlds selected. The console which was master will go into a dormant state with DMX disabled.  Consoles must be running Titan v8 or above to join a multi user or backup session with another Titan v8 console.  **For Titan Mobile:**  > Network Discovery must be enabled in the Windows User Profile you are using or consoles will not be able to see each other on the network.

Capture visualiser requires a capable graphics card. If you have problems with Capture,       ensure you have installed the latest drivers for your graphics card from the manufacturer.  Simply download and run the Titan PC Suite installer from the Avolites website. The first time you run the Editor you will need to license the software to the AvoKey; follow the instructions given on screen by the Authenticator system.  Once licensed, you have a choice of how Titan will operate:      If you run Titan Go with an Editor/Simulator AvoKey, you will get     one universe of DMX (via Art Net) with no spoilers. With a T1 or T2     connected you will get one or two universes of DMX via XLR and     Art Net with no spoilers.      If you run a simulated console, you will get full DMX output on all     universes but periodically random DMX values will be sent down all     DMX outputs as a \"spoiler\", please wait for this to stop before     continuing programming.

If you need to output more universes, it is recommended to network the console to one or more Avolites TitanNet processing nodes. This off loads the DMX processing, allowing the console to control up to 64 universes of DMX in total. See the [DMX output section](system settings/dmx output mapping.md#configuring dmx outputs) for more information.  The console has DMX outputs on 5 pin XLR for direct connection to fixtures and dimmers, and can send DMX over Ethernet and wireless Ethernet systems to allow connection to remote DMX Ethernet nodes, media servers, and so on.  When you patch a dimmer or fixture you tell Titan which of the DMX universes it is on. Each universe can be configured to come out of one or more of the standard DMX outputs on the back of the console, and/or over an [Ethernet protocol](networking/controlling fixtures over a network.md).  The [Arena includes a built in Ethernet switch](networking/connecting the arena to a network.md) and has an optical network connection.  > By default on a new show, the XLRs on the console are automatically connected to DMX lines starting at line 1, however if you are loading a show from a different model of console or the simulator, check the DMX Settings option to confirm how the DMX outputs are set up.  The 5 pin XLR sockets on the console are wired like this:    |   Pin #   | Use          |   |           |              |   |   Pin 1   |   Earth      |   |   Pin 2   |   Data       |   |   Pin 3   |   Data +     |   |   Pin 4   |   Not used   |   |   Pin 5   |   Not used   |   Each DMX line should pass through all the fixtures to be connected on that line one after the other and have a DMX terminator fitted at the end (120 ohm resistor between pins 2 and 3). You should not split the DMX lines using passive splitters (Y splits) as this can corrupt the data. ",

This gives you extra screen space for workspace windows which can be handy for showing Visualiser or additional buttons. Touch monitors are very useful to give additional control surfaces. We advise you use a monitor compatible with Windows Touch to avoid problems with touchscreen drivers. Titan Mobile will also support 2 monitors if the PC you are using has the facility.  An external monitor is disabled by default and will show a \\'disabled\\' message. To enable, switch to System mode (press \\<Avo\\>+\\<Disk\\>) and select \\[Display Setup\\] then press \\[External Display Disconnected\\]. The option will change to \\[External Display Connected\\] and the display will be enabled.  If you need to change the monitor resolution or settings, touch \\'Tools\\' at the very top of the screen and select \\'Control Panel\\', then \\'External Monitor\\', then select the option to match the resolution of your monitor.

If you are using an external non touch monitor on a console without a built in keyboard/touchpad you will need a mouse to access the buttons on it, or on the Sapphire Touch you can use the trackball in mouse mode.  You may need to use a small USB hub to connect additional devices if the console does not have enough USB sockets itself.  All consoles provide MIDI connections which can be used to trigger playbacks or connect MIDI timecode to the console for timecode controlled cue lists. Except for Pearl Expert, a SMPTE input is provided on the rear panel to allow the console to be linked to a timecode source. MIDI cannot be used with the T1 dongle, but can be used with T2 if you attach a USB MIDI device.  You can connect the console to a LAN (local area network) using the RJ45 network socket on the rear. This allows you to operate many more universes of DMX using DMX network protocols, and also allows backup and multi user consoles to be connected to each other. The Arena has several network ports and also has one or two optical fibre terminals allowing direct fibre connection to the control network.  One or two 3 pin XLR sockets for desk lamps are provided on the rear of the console. Suitable lamps are available from Avolites. The lamps are 12 volt DC, wired from pins 1 (negative) and 2 (positive) of the XLR (not all desk lamps are wired like this and may require rewiring to work). You can set the brightness of the desk lamps from System mode. ",
