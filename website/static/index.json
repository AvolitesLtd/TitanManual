The [Exchange Fixtures](../patching/changing-the-patch.md#exchange-mapping) function may also be\r\nused to help with this situation.\r\n\r\nFixtures are positioned using the wheels. Select one or more fixtures\r\nusing the [Fixture select or Group buttons](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#selecting-fixtures-and-dimmers-for-control) and turn them on by pressing\r\n[Locate](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#setting-fixtures-to-a-start-position-locate). Press the \\[Position - Orientation\\] context menu button to\r\nswitch the wheels to Visualiser mode *(or press Softkey G at the top\r\nlevel menu until the display shows Wheels-Visualiser)*.\r\n\r\nSelect **Position** attribute, then use the wheels to change the X/Y/Z\r\nposition of the fixture(s). If you select multiple fixtures, pressing\r\nthe \\[Scale-Fan\\] context menu button or the **Fan** button allows you to\r\nevenly spread out the fixtures. The [Fan curve/group/split options](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#fan-mode) also\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nTouch above or below the wheel value to nudge the setting up or down by\r\none step.

The wheels will now pivot the fixtures in the X/Y/Z axes. Again\r\nyou can use the [**Fan**](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#fan-mode) button to give a spread of angles on multiple\r\nfixtures.\r\n\r\nThe X/Y/Z rotation operates like a 3-axis camera gimbal - imagine the\r\nfixture within three pivoting rings (see left hand picture below). In\r\nsome orientations, the X and Z rotation will seem to do the same thing\r\nand some rotations seem to be impossible to achieve - this is called\r\ngimbal lock and happens when two of the \"rings\" are lined up with each\r\nother (right hand picture below). Change the Y rotation by 90 degrees to\r\nenable you to achieve other angles.\r\n\r\n![gimbal](/docs/images/gimbal.jpeg)\\\r\n*Illustration by MathsPoetry*\r\n\r\nPress the **Position** button a third time to switch the wheels to Rotation\r\nmode. This is similar to Orientation but if you have multiple fixtures\r\nselected, the fixtures rotate as a group about the middle fixture.\r\n\r\n>It's easier to see what position fixtures are in if you change the tilt angle so they aren't pointing straight down (or up).

If quad split is selected, the other 4 buttons select which view\r\nyou are controlling.\r\n\r\n![Camera movements in Capture Visualiser Workspace Window](/docs/images/Camera-movements-in-Capture-Visualiser-Workspace-Window.png)\r\n\r\nThe left hand pad moves the camera **left and right**, and towards and away\r\nfrom the stage.\r\n\r\nThe middle pad moves the camera **up and down**.\r\n\r\nThe right hand pad can be set to rotate or orbit mode\r\n\r\n-   **Rotate:** turns the camera to face left, right, up, down\r\n\r\n-   **Orbit:** orbits the camera around the stage in a circular path keeping\r\n    it pointed at the same object.\r\n\r\nPress the \\[Move Camera\\] context button to link camera movement to the\r\nwheels. This also opens the **Set Coordinates** menu with softkeys allowing\r\nyou to enter numeric camera positions.\r\n\r\nPress the \\[Rotate Camera\\] or \\[Orbit Camera\\] context buttons to link\r\ncamera rotation or orbit to the wheels and allow numeric entry on the\r\nsoftkeys.\r\n\r\nCapture Appearance options\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Appearance tab of the [Settings window](#setting-up-the-stage-and-rigging) allows you to set the\r\nfollowing parameters:\r\n\r\n- **Ambient lighting** (background light level)\r\n\r\n- **Smoke density** (called Atmosphere in full Capture))\r\n\r\n- **Smoke variation** (also called Atmosphere contrast - mix between haze\r\n    and moving smoke effects - 0%=all haze, 100%=all smoke)\r\n\r\n- **Smoke speed** (also called Atmosphere speed - rate of change of moving\r\n    smoke effect)\r\n\r\n- **Exposure adjustment** (camera brightness control)\r\n\r\n- **Bloom amount** (visible halo around lights)\r\n\r\n- **Rendering settings detail** (this affects the refresh rate of the\r\n    simulator. If you have a lot of beams visible you may need to change\r\n    this to Low to improve the refresh rate).",

The chase will start to run. The bottom line of the\r\nscreen relating to the playback fader shows the current cue number and\r\nspeed of the chase.\r\n\r\n![Chase playing on a playback](/docs/images/Chase-playing-on-a-playback.png)\r\n\r\n> The HTP (intensity) channels in the chase will be controlled by the\r\n    fader; if [fade times](chase-timing.md) are programmed, the fade will stop at the fader\r\n    level. The other channels (LTP) will be set as soon as the fader\r\n    moves above zero according to the fade times programmed in the\r\n    chase. You can set the point at which the LTP channels activate from\r\n    the [User settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md) menu.\r\n\r\nWhile the chase is running, the area of the screen above the wheels\r\nshows details of the chase steps:\r\n\r\n![Connected chase with speed and crossfade controls](/docs/images/Connected-chase-with-speed-and-crossfade-controls.png)\r\n\r\nYou can temporarily pause the chase by pressing the \\<Stop\\> button near\r\nthe wheels. Press \\<Go\\> to resume playback.\r\n\r\nThere are [many options](chase-options.md) you can set to determine the way the chase runs\r\nand these are described in the rest of this chapter.\r\n\r\nConnecting a Chase for Control\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you fire a chase, the wheels and \\<Stop\\>/\\<Go\\> buttons are automatically\r\nallocated to control the speed and crossfade of the chase - this is\r\ncalled **connecting** the chase. If you have more than one chase running,\r\nyou can choose which chase is connected to the controls using the\r\n\\<Connect\\> button.\r\n\r\n-   Connect a different chase to the controls by pressing \\<Connect\\>\r\n    then the Swop button of the chase you want to control.\r\n\r\n-   Disconnect a chase from the controls by double pressing \\<Connect\\>.\r\n\r\n-   You can turn off the **\"Auto Connect\"** option in the [User\r\n    Settings > Wheels menu](../system-settings/user-settings.md#auto-connect) if you don't want to connect to a chase when\r\n    you fire it. You will have to use the \\<Connect\\> button to control\r\n    the chase if you do this.\r\n\r\n-   There is a further option \"Auto View on Connect\" in the [User\r\n    Settings > Wheels menu](../system-settings/user-settings.md#auto-view-on-connect) which will automatically open the [view window](editing-a-chase.md#opening-a-chase-for-editing)\r\n    for a chase when you fire the playback. *This is useful to keep the\r\n    correct chase view open as you swap between chases.*\r\n\r\n> Normally if you change the speed or crossfade of a chase, the new\r\n    setting is saved. However you can set this change to be temporary,\r\n    so that when the show is reloaded the speed and fade will go back to\r\n    the previously saved settings. Go to [User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md)\r\n    (\\<Avo\\> + \\[User\r\n    Settings\\], in the Times tab set the option **[Connected View Sets](../system-settings/user-settings.md#connected-view-sets)** to\r\n    **Temporary Speed**. You can still save a temporary speed by pressing\r\n    \\[Save Temporary Speed\\] in the Set Times menu.\r\n\r\nSetting Speed and Crossfade for a Chase\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe left wheel is assigned to control the speed of the chase it is\r\nconnected to. The speed is shown in Beats Per Minute (BPM) on the\r\ndisplay. You can also enter a speed from the keypad as described below.\r\nThe last speed you set on the wheel is always remembered, you do not\r\nhave to tell Titan to save it.\r\n\r\n**Crossfade** is the \"slope\" between cues; with a crossfade of 0, the\r\nfixtures snap instantly to the next cue, but with a crossfade of 100,\r\nthe fixtures spend the whole cue time fading to the next cue. With a\r\ncrossfade of 50, the fixtures delay for half the cue time and fade for\r\nthe other half of the time.\r\n\r\n![Chases crossfade diagram](/docs/images/Chases-crossfade-diagram.png)\r\n\r\nYou set the crossfade and speed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Press \\[Edit Times\\] from the top level menu then the **Swop** button of\r\nthe chase.\r\n\r\n2. To set the **crossfade**, press \\[Xfade\\] and type the fade from **0 - 100**.\\\r\n*0 = no fade (the chase will \"snap\"), 100 = max fade (the chase will\r\nmove continuously from step to step).*\r\n\r\n3. To set the **speed**, press \\[Speed\\], type the new speed, then press\r\n\\<Enter\\>.\\\r\n*The speed can be set in Beats Per Minute (BPM) or seconds\r\ndepending in the [User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md).*\r\n\r\nThere are other options you can set for the chase from this menu\r\nincluding Fixture Overlap, which are described in the [Chase Timing](chase-timing.md).\r\n\r\nYou can set individual times for each cue in a chase and unlink cues\r\nfrom each other so they wait for you to press the Go button. This is\r\ndone using the [Playback View](editing-a-chase.md#opening-a-chase-for-editing),\r\nor the [\\<Unfold\\> function](editing-a-chase.md#editing-a-chase-using-unfold) which is\r\ndescribed in [Editing a Chase](editing-a-chase.md).\r\n\r\nYou can select whether the chase speed is displayed in seconds or in\r\nBeats Per Minute (BPM). Press \\<Avo\\> and \\[User Settings\\], then press\r\n\\[Tempo Units\\] to set the option to \\[Tempo Units Seconds\\] or \\[Tempo\r\nUnits Beats Per Minute (BPM)\\].\r\n\r\nYou can also allocate a [Speed Master](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#speed-and-size-masters)\r\nto the chase which will allow you\r\nto modify the chase speed during playback, see\r\n[Speed and Size Masters](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#speed-and-size-masters).\r\n\r\nManually Controlling the Steps of a Chase\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can pause a chase, if the chase is connected to the wheels, by\r\npressing the \\<Stop\\> button next to the wheels. Press the red \\<Go\\> button\r\nto resume playback of the chase.\r\n\r\nWhile the chase is stopped you can use the \\<Prev Step\\>/\\<Next Step\\>\r\nbuttons *(← and → on some consoles)* next to the \\<Connect\\> button to\r\nmove to the next or previous step. The programmed fade time will be used\r\nwhen moving between steps, unless you enable the [user setting \\[Chase\r\nSnap\\]](../system-settings/user-settings.md#chase-snap), or press \\<Snap\\> button if the console has one.\r\n\r\nYou can also configure the blue and grey buttons of the playback handle\r\nto be Stop and Go. This uses the [Key Profiles function](../system-settings/key-profiles.md).\r\n\r\n1. Hold \\<Avo\\> and press \\[Edit Current Key Profile\\].\r\n\r\n2. If you are using the default [Key Profile] which is not editable, you\r\nwill be prompted to add a new profile.\r\n\r\n3. Press \\[Chases\\] then choose either the Blue key or the Grey key.\r\n\r\n4. Select \\[Go\\] or \\[Stop\\] from the list of functions. Then press \\<Exit\\>\r\nand set the function for the other key if required.\r\n\r\n5. Press \\<Exit\\> to continue using the console.\r\n\r\nChanging Chase Direction\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe \\<Prev Step\\>/\\<Next Step\\> (← and → on some consoles) buttons next\r\nto \\<Connect\\> set the direction of the connected chase. *If fitted*, the\r\n↔ double-ended arrow button sets **bounce** mode where the chase will run to\r\nthe end then reverse. The \\<Review\\> key sets the chase to **random**.\r\n\r\nJumping to a Step\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nYou can jump directly to a step in a chase by pressing \\<Connect\\>, then\r\ntyping in the desired step number, then pressing \\<Enter\\> or softkey A.\r\nAlternatively at the top level menu you can type the step number then\r\npress \\<Connect\\>.",

To access overlaid fixtures, drag\r\n    off the fixture which is hiding it, or select the hidden fixture and\r\n    use the wheels to move it somewhere visible.\r\n\r\n-   You can use the Fan button to evenly spread fixtures in the layout.\r\n\r\n-   To move or rotate fixtures, select and drag, or use the wheels. You\r\n    can click on the \"up\" and \"down\" areas in the wheel display to nudge\r\n    the values up and down - 1 pixel for position and 45 degrees for\r\n    rotate. If you press the @ button for the wheel, a window opens\r\n    allowing you to type in the values numerically.\r\n\r\n-   If you click the context menu button \\[Position and Angle\\] it will\r\n    change to \\[Scale\\] which allows you to spread out or compress the\r\n    cells in a multi-cell fixture. This is useful to get cells located\r\n    correctly if you have some fixtures with large cell spacing and some\r\n    with small spacing.\\\r\n\r\n    ![Position](/docs/images/Position-2.png)\r\n\r\n    ![Scale](/docs/images/Scale.png)\r\n\r\n-   The Layout Editor is described in more detail with examples in the\r\n    [Pixel Mapper section](../effects/pixel-mapper.md). There are also some features\r\n    to help with [Synergy/Ai mapping](../synergy/operating-synergy.md#layout-editor-with-ai-server).\r\n\r\n> You can temporarily randomize the fixture order when selecting fixtures using a group by holding down the group button and pressing \\[Random Order\\] which appears as a softkey option while the button is he",

You\r\ncan also use [Groups](../controlling-fixtures/fixture-groups.md) to select multiple fixtures.\r\n\r\nIf the fixture is patched on a fader handle, press the blue button to\r\nselect the fixture.\r\n\r\n![Fixtures Window](/docs/images/Fixtures-Window.png)\r\n\r\n1. Press the Select buttons for the fixtures you want. Touch buttons\r\nwill light up pale blue when selected, physical buttons will light\r\nbrightly.\r\n\r\n2.

The picture above shows the first two fixtures\r\n    selected, with the second three in the programmer and the others\r\n    unselected.\r\n\r\n-   You can select fixtures on another page by touching one of the page\r\n    buttons to the left of the fixture buttons, if you have \\'Pages\\'\r\n    set to Show (using the context button). Otherwise you can use the\r\n    scroll slider to show more buttons. On fader handles, Page buttons\r\n    are provided to change pages -- on the Pearl Expert these are above\r\n    the numeric keypad, on other consoles they are next to the faders.\r\n\r\n-   Using [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md) you can set the\r\n    fixture touch button to latch mode so that it turns the fixture's\r\n    dimmer channel on (like putting a preset fader to full).\r\n\r\n",

The attributes\r\navailable depend on the fixture type.

Repeat from 1 to change other attributes of the selected fixtures.\r\n\r\nSome other things to know about attributes:\r\n\r\n-   If an attribute is in the programmer, it is highlighted (as shown\r\n    with the \"Green\" setting in the screen picture above).

Press the\r\n    Attribute button again to toggle through the attributes.\r\n\r\n![Toggle Attributes](/docs/images/Toggle-Attributes.png)\r\n\r\n-   The wheels operate in an \"acceleration\" mode. If you spin the wheel\r\n    fast, the fixture changes in larger steps. If you move the wheel\r\n    slowly, the fixture moves in its smallest increment.\r\n\r\n-   Holding down the \\<Avo\\> button while turning a wheel puts the wheel\r\n    into \"Fast\" mode. When in this mode, a single rotation of the wheel\r\n    changes the attribute you are controlling over its full range. For\r\n    example, if while moving the Pan wheel you hold down \\<Avo\\> the\r\n    fixture will make a complete pan movement between end stops in one\r\n    rotation of the wheel.\r\n\r\n-   Some LED colour mixing fixtures have a Virtual Dimmer function\r\n    (using the Intensity wheel) which offers intensity control by\r\n    mastering the RGB levels when the fixture itself does not provide an\r\n    intensity channel.\r\n\r\n",

If you use a group to select the fixtures, the\r\norder you selected the fixtures when you recorded the group is used.\r\n\r\nThe fan effect, while normally used on pan or tilt attributes, can be\r\napplied to any attribute.\r\n\r\n1. Select the fixtures you want to fan.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\<Fan\\>.\r\n\r\n3. Select the attribute you want to Fan using the attribute bank\r\nbuttons.\r\n\r\n4. Set the amount of fan using the attribute wheels.\r\n\r\n5. Turn off Fan by pressing the Fan button again when you have\r\nfinished. Fan will turn off automatically if you change the fixture\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nIf you have selected fixtures from multiple groups, you can choose\r\nwhether the fan effect works with or ignores the groups. For example if\r\nyou have 12 fixtures across the stage in 3 groups of 4, you may want a\r\nfan of light beams spread evenly across the stage, or you may want 3\r\ngroups of separately fanned light beams.\r\n\r\nBy holding down \\<Fan\\> you can select:\r\n\r\n-   \\[Ignore Groups\\] All fixtures are fanned as one large group\r\n\r\n-   \\[Fan Group as Fixture\\] All fixtures in a group take on the same\r\n    value.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Fan Within Group\\] Fan runs across individual fixtures in each\r\n    group.\r\n\r\nHolding down \\<Fan\\> also allows you to select the Curve used for the\r\nfan. The different curves allow you to obtain different fan effects.\r\n\r\nFan mode needs to be used on at least 4 fixtures to give good effects.\r\nIf you have an odd number of fixtures, the central fixture will not\r\nchange in fan mode.\r\n\r\nPress \\<Fan\\> again to leave Fan mode. Any effects you have set will\r\nremain in the programmer.\r\n\r\n> It's all too easy to accidentally leave Fan mode turned on and be very confused about why the wheels aren't working properly, so turn it off as soon as you have completed the effect. To avoid this there is a [User Setting](../system-settings/user-settings.md) 'Press and hold Fan'. If enabled, you have to hold down \\<Fan\\> to enable Fan mode.\r\n\r\n",

After selecting **Cue List Record**, turn on \\[Autoload Live Playbacks\\]\r\nin the \\[Advanced Options\\] menu of the cuelist record screen.\r\n\r\n2. Turn on the playbacks you wish to load for this cue.\r\n\r\n3. **Save the cue**. Active playbacks will be saved as Autoloads.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo manually edit autoloads use the playback view for the cue list:\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<View/Open\\>\r\n\r\n2. Press the **Select button** of the Cue List.\r\n\r\n3. The cues in the cue list are shown on the screen. Click on the\r\n**Autoload** you wish to change. *(You will need to set the window to full\r\nscreen size or scroll across to see the Autoload column. If the Autoload\r\ncolumn is not shown, click on the Show All button on the left of the\r\nwindow.)*\r\n\r\n4. Press the **Select button** of the playback which is to be loaded. The\r\nplayback legend appears on the softkeys.\r\n\r\n5. You can continue to add Autoloads to other cues, or press \\<Exit\\>\r\nto finish.\r\n\r\n![Cue List Window with Autoload playback](/docs/images/Cue-List-Window-with-Autoload-playback.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe Autoloaded playback will be fired when\r\nthe cue starts, and killed when the cue list moves on to the next cue,\r\nunless you have also loaded the playback into the next cue.\r\n\r\nYou can set options for each Autoloaded playback by pressing the softkey\r\nwhere the Autoloaded playback is shown.\r\n\r\nFor a cue, the only option is \\[Remove this Autoload\\].\r\n\r\nFor a chase or cue list, **softkey B** lets you select whether to load the\r\nplayback from the *start*, to start at a *specific cue*, or to press *Go* on\r\nthe target playback.\r\n\r\nIn the Autoload Times column you can set fade in, fade out and delay\r\ntimes for the autoloaded playback. Normally the autoload will use the\r\ntimes set for the cue, but you can also select \\[Use Individual Target\r\nTimes\\] which will use the times set in the autoloaded playback, or you\r\ncan set independent times yourself.\r\n\r\nRunning a Key Macro from a Cue List\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can program a cue within a cue list to trigger a key macro. This\r\nallows you to set up custom actions which can be performed when a cue in\r\na cue list fires; for example you may want to lamp on your fixtures as\r\nthe first cue in the cue list.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Options\\> (or the \\[Options\\] softkey on the root menu)\r\n\r\n2. Select the **cue list**\r\n\r\n3. Select \\[Macros\\]\r\n\r\n4. In the **Playback View window**, select the **step** you want to add a macro\r\nto\r\n\r\n5. Press the button(s) for the macro(s) you want to attach to the step,\r\nor press \\[Add\\] and choose an action from the list.\r\n\r\n6. The **\"Macros\"** column shows the macros you have added.\r\n\r\n> You can remove macros by selecting the cue, pressing the softkey for\r\n    the macro you wish to remove and then pressing \\[Remove Link\\].\r\n\r\nKeyboard Shortcuts/Syntax for Cue Lists\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe following keyboard syntax can be used for fast cue list recording\r\nand editing. These commands work for the selected or currently connected\r\nplayback where **n** is the cue number.\r\n\r\nShortcut | Action\r\n--- | ---\r\n\\<Record\\>, \\<Connect\\>, **n**, \\<Enter\\> | Record cue **n**\r\n\\<Copy\\>, \\<Connect\\>, n | Copy cue **n**\r\n\\<Delete\\>, \\<Connect\\>, n | Delete cue **n**\r\n\\<Include\\>, \\<Connect\\>, n | Include cue **n**\r\n\\<Connect\\>, n, \\<Go\\> | Go cue **n**\r",

Below\r\nthis the times for the next cue are shown - in time with up arrow and out time with down arrow,\r\nd for delay and f for fade. If the cue list is set to manual crossfade a red 'M' is shown.\r\n\r\n![Playback handle of running cue list](/docs/images/Playback-handle-of-running-cue-list.png)\r\n\r\nYou can also open the Playback View window to show more details of the\r\ncue list by clicking the Cue List legend area or press \\<View/Open\\>\r\nthen the **swop button** of the playback.

You\r\ncan change the way the autoscroll works using the view options (click\r\nthe options/cog icon at the top of the window).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n-   The HTP levels of cues in the cue list are mastered by the fader level.\r\n\r\n-   You can **pause** a fade by pressing the \\<Stop\\> button above \\<Go\\>.\r\n    Press \\<Go\\> again to resume the fade.\r\n\r\n-   You can **skip** to any cue in the cue list by selecting a \"next\" cue\r\n    using Wheel A, or using the left/right arrow keys. When you press\r\n    \\<Go\\>, the cue list will run that cue next. If you decide you don't want\r\n\tto skip, you can reset the cue list (so the next cue will be the cue after the current cue)\r\n\tby pressing the \\<Prev Cue\\> and \\<Next Cue\\> buttons together.\r\n\t\r\n-\tYou can go back to the previous cue following fade times by pressing \\<Stop\\>\r\n\twhile the cue list is paused.\r\n\r\n-   You can snap back to the previous cue by pressing the \\<Snap Back\\>\r\n    button *(not on all consoles)*\r\n\r\n-   On consoles with a \\<Snap\\> button *(Arena and Tiger Touch 2)*, when\r\n    you turn on the \\<Snap\\> button the \\<Prev\\>/\\<Next\\> buttons will\r\n    snap immediately to the cue rather than going to the previous/next\r\n    cue using the programmed times.

See\r\n    section [Cue List Timing](cue-list-timing.md#running-a-cue-list-to-timecode).\r\n\r\n-   You can change the time for the next cue by entering the time on the\r\n    keypad then pressing \\<Go\\>. You can jump to another cue and set a\r\n    different time by typing the cue number then press \\<Connect\\>, then\r\n    type the time and press \\<Go\\>.\r\n\r\nKilling a Cue List\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nOnce a cue list is fired, it remains active until you kill it. You do\r\nthis by holding down the \\<Avo\\> button and pressing the blue Select\r\nbutton of the cue list's handle.\r\n\r\nYou can change this in the playback [Options](../cues/playback-options.md) to make the cue list\r\nautomatically clear when the fader reaches zero (press \\[Playback\r\nOptions\\] at the program menu, then press the Select button of the cue\r\nlist, then select \\[Fader\\] \\[Fader Mode Intensity Kill At 0\\].\r\n\r\nYou can also use [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md#cue-lists) to configure one of the handle buttons to\r\nrelease the cue list.\r\n\r\n> While the cue list remains active, any shapes/effects stored in the current cue will run even if the fader is at zero. If you are working with a cue list and have unexplained shapes occurring, check all cue lists have been killed.\r\n\r\nTracking\r\n--------\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/B2fTri0G2-A?t=20 \"Tracking in Cuelists\")\r\n\r\nBy default, cue lists run in tracking mode. Only changes in attributes\r\nare stored, everything else just continues at the level it was\r\npreviously set to. Tracking mode is usually used for [theatrical\r\nperformances](theatre-programming.md) because it makes editing much easier; if you need to adjust\r\na dimmer level at the start of a scene, you don't have to go through and\r\nchange the level on every cue for that scene, the change just tracks\r\nthrough the other cues until a new level is stored.\r\n\r\nYou can enable or disable Tracking mode globally for the whole cue list,\r\nor each cue can have Tracking mode set individually from the Playback\r\nView window (or Options, \\[Cue Options\\]).\r\n\r\nSettings are:\r\n\r\nSetting | Action\r\n--- | ---\r\n\\[Global\\] *(default)* | Obeys the global setting for the cue list.\r\n\\[Track\\] | The cue will track\r\n\\[Block\\] | The cue will not take tracking states from previous cues. All subsequent cues will track from the Block cue.\r\n\\[Solo Excluding Shapes\\] | No states are tracked into or out of the cue, but shapes will track into the cue, except for dimmer shapes which will not track. This lets you have a cue that solos all levels but allows non-dimmer shapes to continue.\r\n\\[Cue Only\\] | Changes in this cue will not track to subsequent cues. Unchanged states from previous cues will be restored in subsequent cues.\r\n\\[Solo\\] | No states are tracked into or out of a solo cue. States from previous cues will track to subsequent cues but will not appear in the solo cue.\r\n\\[Block Shapes\\] | Any tracked shapes will stop from this cue. Other attributes will continue to be tracked. This lets you create a point where you can guarantee all shapes will stop.\r\n\r\nMove In Dark (MID) Functions\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen using moving lights in theatre, often you would like them to be\r\npositioned ready for the next cue so that you do not see them moving.\r\nThe Move In Dark function does this by automatically positioning the\r\nfixture for the next cue when it is not lit.\r\n\r\nMove In Dark options can be set either for the whole cue list or for\r\nindividual cues.\r\n\r\nOptions for the whole cue list are set by pressing \\<Options\\> (or the \\[Options\\] softkey on the top level menu)\r\nthen the select button for the cue list, then \\[Playback\\].\r\n\r\nSetting | Action\r\n---|---\r\n\\[Disabled\\] | Prevents Move In Dark functions for all cues in the cue list regardless of the individual cue settings\r\n\\[Early\\] | Will attempt to position a fixture as soon as possible unless overridden in an individual cue\r\n\\[Late\\] | Will position the fixture as late as possible\r\n\\[Off\\] *(default)* | Turns off Move In Dark unless enabled in individual cues\r\n\r\nFor individual cues the options are set using the Playback Window.\r\n\r\nSetting | Action\r\n---|---\r\n\\[Global\\] *(default)* | Uses the cue list's global setting\r\n\\[Cue Number\\] | Specifies a cue where you would like the move to occur\r\n\\[Cue Offset\\] | Specifies a preferred number of cues in advance\r\n\\[Disabled\\] | Prevents Move In Dark for this cue\r\n\\[Early\\] | Will move as early as possible\r\n\\[Late\\] | Will move as late as possible\r\n\r\nMove In Dark delay and Move In Dark fade times can be set for the\r\nwhole cue list or for each cue using the Set Times menu. Each cue\r\nalso has a Move In Dark Inhibit option which prevents any movements\r\nduring that cue (useful if you need to prevent fixture noise at a\r\nparticular point).\r\n\r\nIf the fixture has its intensity above zero or Move In Dark is\r\ninhibited when the Move In Dark is supposed to occur, the console\r\nwill attempt the movement in the nearest suitable cue instead.\r\n\r\nKey Profile Options for Cue Lists\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nUsing [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md), you can assign different functions to the blue and\r\ngrey buttons of the playback handle. (*The Sapphire Touch also has a\r\nblack button)*. If the cue list is stored on a touch button you can\r\nassign a function to that. See [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md#cue-lists) for a full list of functions.\r\n",

The display\r\nshows which cue you are working with. You can select which cue is active\r\nusing **Wheel A** or **softkey A** of the **Cue Times menu**.\r\n\r\n*See the [diagram below](#cue-linking--link-offset) for more information about overlaps and fade times.*\r\n\r\n1.

To change which cue you are editing, scroll through the list using\r\n**Wheel A** or press \\[Cue Number\\] then type the cue number you want to\r\nedit and press \\<Enter\\>.\r\n\r\n\t- The Chase arrow buttons to the right of the\r\nConnect button also step through the cues.\r\n\r\n\t- You can select a range of cues, enabling you to alter the timings of\r\n    multiple cues all in one go, by using **Wheel B**, or in the [Playback\r\n    View window](editing-cue-lists.md#playback-view-window), dragging across the cues you want to select in the\r\n    grid.\r\n\r\n3. **Setting times**\r\n\r\n    -   To set the **delay time** between pressing \\<Go\\> and the cue starting,\r\n    press \\[Delay In\\] then type a time in seconds and press \\<Enter\\>.\r\n\r\n    -   To set the **fade in time** of the cue, press \\[Fade In\\] then type a\r\n    time in seconds and press \\<Enter\\>. *Both HTP and LTP channels are\r\n    affected by the fade.*\r\n\r\n    -   The **fade out time** of the cue is set by default to be the same as the\r\n    fade in time. You can change the fade out time by pressing \\[Fade\r\n    Out\\], then type the time in seconds and press \\<Enter\\>. To set\r\n    equal to Fade In time, delete the time and leave the box blank.\\\r\n    *The fade out time starts when the next cue fires, so if you set the\r\n    time to 1 second, the outgoing cue would start a 1 second fade out\r\n    as the new cue begins its fade in.*\r\n\r\n    -   The \\[Delay Out\\] setting of the cue would normally be used if the\r\n    cue links automatically to the next cue, and sets a wait time\r\n    before the next cue starts its fade in. So the outgoing cue would\r\n    start to fade out, and the delay out time would run before the new\r\n    cue begins its fade in.\r\n\r\nCue Linking & Link Offset\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nCues in cue lists may be linked together, allowing you to build up\r\ncomplex self-timed sequences. The link options are set using the\r\nsoftkeys and are:\r\n\r\nLink Option | Action\r\n---|---\r\n**\\[Link Wait For Go\\]** | The cue waits for the Go button to be pressed then fires immediately. *Link Offset is disabled.*\r\n**\\[Link After Previous Cue\\]** | The cue fires when the previous cue has finished its delay in and fade in times. A Link Offset can be set to add a delay between the previous cue finishing and this cue firing. The offset can be given as a time in seconds, or as a percentage of the fade time of the previous cue.\r\n**\\[Link With Previous Cue\\]** | The cue fires at the same time as the previous cue fires. A Link Offset can be set to add a delay between the previous cue firing and this cue firing, set either in seconds or as a percentage of the fade time of the previous cue.\r\n\r\n![Cue List Linking Diagram](/docs/images/Cue-List-Linking-Diagram.png)\r\n\r\nThese options allow you to create complex\r\nself timed sequences by building up simple steps. For example if you\r\nwanted the following effect:\r\n\r\n-   \\<Go\\> is pressed, fixture one starts fading up over 20s\r\n\r\n-   After 10s fixture two fades up over 15s\r\n\r\n-   Both lights stay on for 5s\r\n\r\n-   Both lights go off in 3s\r\n\r\nYou could program\r\n\r\n-   **Cue 1** - Fixture 1 @ 100%, Fade In 20s, Link Wait For Go\r\n\r\n-   **Cue 2** - Fixture 2 @ 100%, Fade In 15s, Link With Previous, Link\r\n    Offset 10s\r\n\r\n-   **Cue 3** - Fixture 1 AND 2 @ 0%, Fade Out 3s, Link After Previous, Link\r\n    Offset 5s\r\n\r\n> To obtain the effect which was called *\"cue overlap\"* in previous versions of software, use \\[Link With Previous Cue\\] and set a percentage Link Offset time. Link Offset of 100% is equivalent to Cue Overlap of 0% and vice versa.\r\n\r\nIndividual Attribute Fade Times\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can set individual fade times for each **IPCGBES** attribute group. You\r\ncan also select which fixtures this is applied to. For example you can\r\nmake the position change take 2 seconds, but the colour change take 10\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nAdditionally you can set individual times for each attribute so you\r\ncould make the pan fade over a different time to the tilt.\r\n\r\nTo set times for an attribute group, first select the Set Times menu and\r\ngo to the cue you want to set as [described above](#time-and-fade-options-for-cue-lists), then press G \\[Next\\]\r\nto go to the second page of options.\r\n\r\n1. Press C \\[Attribute times\\].\r\n\r\n2. All fixtures in the cue will be selected. *If you don't want to\r\nchange the times for any fixtures, deselect them now.* You can press the\r\n**ALL** button (below Next Time) to select all fixtures in the cue or\r\n**Shift + ALL** to deselect all fixtures.\r\n\r\n3. Press the softkey for the attribute group you want to change.\r\n\r\n4. Press A \\[Delay\\] to set the **delay time**, or press B \\[Fade\\] to set\r\nthe **fade time**. Press G \\[Use global\\] to remove the attribute group\r\ntiming and go back to the normal delay/fade times for the cue.\r\n\r\n>  You can use \\[Individual Attributes\\] to set times for one attribute\r\n    within the group, for example just Pan from within the Position\r\n    group. You can also use the [Cue View window](editing-cue-lists.md#editing-values-in-cue-view-window) to set times for\r\n    individual attributes.\r\n\r\nFixture Overlap\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nFor each cue you can set a (linked together) fixture overlap, which\r\ncauses Titan to apply the settings in the cue to each fixture\r\nsequentially giving a \"rolling\" change across the fixtures in the cue.\r\nThis can create some great effects without much programming on your\r\npart.\r\n\r\nPress \\[Fixture Overlap\\] *(on the second page of the [Cue Times menu](#time-and-fade-options-for-cue-lists))*\r\nthen enter 0-100 on the keypad to change how fixtures overlap in the\r\ncue.\r\n\r\n>   **100%** means all fixtures fade together *(the normal setting)*.\r\n>\r\n>   **0%** means that the first fixture will finish its fade before the next\r\n>   one starts.\r\n>\r\n>   **50%** means that the 2^nd^ fixture will start fading when\r\n>   the first one is half way through its fade.\r\n\r\nTo change the fixture order when using overlap, press \\[Set Fixture\r\nOrder\\]. Normally this is the order in which you selected the\r\nfixtures when you programmed the cue. The Fixture window shows the\r\nfixture order in large green numbers. Reorder the fixtures by\r\npressing \\[Step Number\\] then type the start number on the numeric\r\nkeys, then press the fixture **Select** buttons in the order you want\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFor example, to set the order of 8 fixtures, press 1 on the\r\nkeypad, then press the **Select** button of the fixture to be first,\r\nthen the **Select** button for the second, and so on. You can set\r\nseveral fixtures to the same number if you want them to change\r\nsimultaneously. If you press a fixture button twice, it will show X and be excluded\r\nfrom the sequence.\r\n\r\nPress \\<Exit\\> to finish setting the fixture order.\r\n\r\n![Fixtures Window showing fixture order](/docs/images/Fixtures-Window-showing-fixture-order.png)\r\n\r\nRunning a Cue List to Timecode\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/1abZT_ffIvs?t=20 \"Recording Timecode\")\r\n\r\nThe console can run a cue list automatically to a timecode. This is very\r\nuseful for complex performances which must be exactly the same time\r\nevery time, or for unattended operation. Each step in the cue list is\r\nassigned a time at which it will run.\r\n\r\nThe console can have up to 4 separate timecode sources. For each, the\r\ntimecode can be read from the system clock, from an internal timecode\r\nsource, from MIDI, SMPTE or from Winamp. Internal timecode is useful for\r\nprogramming a sequence which will later be triggered by an external\r\ntimecode source.\r\n\r\n1. **Connect** the cue list for which you want to set timecode.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Timecode\\] on the top-level menu.\r\n\r\n3. Press **softkey A** to select Timecode 1-4, and **softkey B** to select the desired\r\ntimecode source.\r\n\r\n4. Press \\[Record\\].\r\n\r\n5. Start the timecode source. *If using internal timecode, press\r\n\\[Play\\] to start it.*\r\n\r\n6. Press the red **Go** button to step each cue at the time you wish the\r\ncue to start.\r\n\r\n7. Press \\[Record\\] when you have finished.\r\n\r\nTo play back a timecoded cue list, press \\[Connected Cue Lists\\] on the\r\nTimecode menu and select the cue list which is to be played. Then press\r\n\\[Timer Disabled/Enabled\\] to enable the timecode input.\r\n\r\nWhen you start the timecode source (or press \\[Play\\] if using internal\r\ntimecode), each cue will fire as the timecode matches its programmed\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nYou can edit the timecode for each cue by using **Wheel A** to select the\r\ncue, then press \\<Enter\\> and type the new timecode for the cue.\r\n\r\n![Playback View Window showing timecoded cues](/docs/images/Playback-View-Window-showing-timecoded-cues.png)\r\n\r\nWhile editing a time you can also use **Wheel B** to select multiple cues,\r\nand use the softkey options to enter a value to change the time of all\r\nthe cues (offset, add a fixed time or subtract a fixed time).\r\n\r\nYou can open a timecode display window for each of the four possible\r\nsources to show you the incoming timecode - press \\[Open Workspace\r\nWindow\\] then \\[Timecode x\\] where x is 1 to 4.\r\n\r\n![Timecode 1 Workspace Window](/docs/images/Timecode-1-Workspace-Window.png)\r\n",

This shows a grid with each cue and allows you to change most\r\nfeatures of the cue. Select the item you want to change in the grid,\r\nand the softkeys will offer you the different options.\r\n\r\nTo change multiple cues at once, draw a box across the items you want to\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThe [Intensity View window](../controlling-fixtures/viewing-and-editing-fixture-values.md#intensity-window) is useful for seeing the state of all\r\nfixtures, see [Intensity View](../controlling-fixtures/viewing-and-editing-fixture-values.md#intensity-window) in [Viewing and Editing Fixture Values](../controlling-fixtures/viewing-and-editing-fixture-values.md).\r\n\r\nEditing Values in Cue View Window\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can edit the value of every fixture in each cue using the Cue View\r\nwindow. Press the **View Cue** button at the right hand end of the [Playback\r\nView window](#playback-view-window).\r\n\r\n![Cue View Window](/docs/images/Cue-View-Window.png)\r\n\r\nYou can then click on the values you want to change and edit them using\r\nthe softkeys.\r\n\r\n-   The context menu buttons allow you to view levels, shapes, effects\r\n    and times for each attribute of each fixture in each cue.\r\n\r\n-   If levels are set from a palette, the **View Palettes** button either\r\n    shows you the palette used, or the underlying value.\r\n\r\n-   If the **View Tracking Values** button is selected, [tracking values](cue-list-playback.md#tracking)\r\n    (values which have tracked through from another cue rather than\r\n    being stored directly in this cue) are shown in light grey.\r\n\r\nMoving and Copying Cues\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nYou can copy or move cues within a cue list or to other cue lists.\r\nEither click and drag the cue in the [Playback\r\nView window](#playback-view-window) (press\r\nOpen/View then the **select** button for the cue list), or use **Unfold** ([next\r\nsection](#editing-a-cue-list-using-unfold)), or you can use a `command-line` style series of keypresses.\r\n\r\n**Copy/Move within the same playback:**\r\n\r\n`COPY/MOVE <playback> <cue> [THRO <cue>] [NOT <cue>] [AND <cue>] @ <cue> ENTER`\r\n\r\n`COPY/MOVE <playback> <cue> [THRO <cue>] [NOT <cue>][AND <cue>] ENTER <cue> ENTER`\r\n\r\n**Copy/Move to the end of the same playback:**\r\n\r\n`COPY/MOVE <playback> <cue> [THRO <cue>] [NOT <cue>] [AND <cue>] @ @`\r\n\r\n`COPY/MOVE <playback> <cue> [THRO <cue>] [NOT <cue>] [AND <cue>] ENTER ENTER`\r\n\r\n**Copy/Move to a different playback:**\r\n\r\n`COPY/MOVE <playback> <cue> [THRO <cue>] [NOT <cue>] [AND <cue>] [@] [ENTER] <playback> <cue> ENTER`\r\n\r\n**Copy/Move to the end of a different playback:**\r\n\r\n`COPY/MOVE <playback> <cue> [THRO <cue>] [NOT <cue>] [AND <cue>] [@] [ENTER] <playback> ENTER`\r\n\r\n`COPY/MOVE <playback> <cue> [THRO <cue>] [NOT <cue>] [AND <cue>] [@] [ENTER] <playback> <playback>`\r\n\r\n> **\\<playback\\>** is a playback swop key, **\\<cue\\>** is the cue number and\r\nsections in square brackets are optional)\r\n\r\nEditing a Cue List using Unfold\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe \\<Unfold\\> button places each cue of the cue list on one of the\r\nplayback faders.

Cues are loaded into the **playback faders**. The display shows the cue\r\nnumbers and legends *(see more cues using softkeys F and G)*.\r\n\r\n3. Raise a **playback fader** to output the contents of that cue *(fade\r\ntimes will operate as programmed)*.\r\n\r\n4. *Various Unfold options are available, detailed below.*\r\n\r\n5. Press \\<Unfold\\> again to exit unfold mode.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n-   To **edit** the contents of a cue: Press \\<Clear\\> to empty the\r\n    programmer, raise the fader to output the cue, make the changes,\r\n    press \\[Record Step\\], then the **Select** button for the cue number.\r\n\r\n-   To **merge** the programmer into the live step, double tap \\[Record\r\n    Step\\].\r\n\r\n-   To change the times or cue linking for the cue, press \\[Edit\r\n    Times\\], then the **Select** button for the cue, then set the times (see\r\n    [Cue List Timing](cue-list-timing.md))\r\n\r\n-   To **insert** a new cue, set up the look for the new cue, press B\r\n    \\[Insert Step\\], then press the playback button where you want the\r\n    new cue to go. All following cues will be shifted on by one and the\r\n    new cue will be given a number in between the two existing cues *(for\r\n    example, if you press playback 3, your new cue will be 2.5)*.\r\n\r\n-   To **move** or **copy** a cue, press the \\<Move\\> or \\<Copy\\> button, press\r\n    the **select** button for the cue you want to move or copy, then press\r\n    the **select** button where you want it to go.\r\n\r\n-   To **delete** a cue, press the \\<Delete\\> button then the **select** button\r\n    for the cue you want to delete. Press the **select** button again to\r\n    confirm.\r\n\r\n-   To change the **cue legend**, press \\[Set Step Legend\\] then the\r\n    playback **select** for the step you want to change.\r\n\r\n-   If the cue list has more cues than there are playback faders, you\r\n    can swop to the next page using softkeys F and G.\r\n\r\nUsing Update to Change Tracked Cues\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nBecause fixture settings in a cue list are [tracked](cue-list-playback.md#tracking) through from previous\r\ncues, if you want to edit a setting you need to find the cue where it\r\nwas originally set.\r\n\r\nThe **Update** function will go back through the cue list from the currently\r\nfired cue and automatically update the correct cue.\r\n\r\n1. With the cue list fired, select the fixtures and change them to the\r\nsettings you want to store.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\<Update\\> *(\\<Record Cue\\>, \\[Update\\] if the console doesn't\r\nhave an Update button)*.\r\n\r\n3. Press \\<Enter\\> to immediately store the new values to the cue list.\r\n\r\n> Alternatively, the softkeys show a list of palettes and playbacks which \r\ncan be updated. Select or deselect these as required.\r\n>\r\n> If you have used the softkey options, press \\<Enter\\> to complete\r\nthe update.\r\n\r\nIf the attributes you have changed were [tracked](cue-list-playback.md#tracking) through from a\r\nprevious cue, Update will update that cue rather than the current one.\r\n\r\nEditing a Cue List Which is Running\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can also edit cues in a cue list while you are running it without\r\nusing [Unfold](#editing-a-cue-list-using-unfold).\r\n\r\n1. **Fire the cue list** by raising its fader.\r\n\r\n2.

This\r\nallows you to build a complete show in a single list and is ideal for\r\n[theatrical shows](cue-lists/theatre-programming.md) where the show must be exactly the same each time. Cue\r\nlists can also be useful in busked shows, especially on consoles with a\r\nsmall number of playback faders, to offer a number of different looks on\r\none fader.\r\n\r\nCue lists differ from [chases](chases.md) in the way the console handles changes\r\nbetween cues. Cue lists track fixture state from previous cues and will\r\nonly change the fixture state if you have modified that fixture in the\r\ncue; if there are no changes stored for the fixture, it will remain in\r\nthe same state. [Chases](chases.md) on the other hand would crossfade between cues,\r\nfading out all fixtures which have no stored information in the new cue.\r\n\r\nYou can change the tracking behaviour of cue lists using the [tracking\r\noption](cue-lists/cue-list-playback.md#tracking) for each cue: Block, This Cue Only and Solo - see Tracking\r\nin the [Cue List Playback](cue-lists/cue-list-playback.md) section).\r\n\r\nTo view the contents of a cue list, touch the playback screen relating\r\nto the fader or press \\<Open/View\\> then the **swop button** of the\r\nplayback.\r\n\r\n![Playback View of Cue List](/docs/images/Cue-List-Window-with-Autoload-playback.png)",

You can then use the \r\n[wheels](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#changing-attributes-using-the-wheels)\r\nand [palettes](../palettes.md) to\r\nchange the settings on the fixture. You can also apply shapes to it.\r\n\r\nIf a fixture is selected after you have changed some attributes then the\r\ncurrent list of fixtures in the Editor is emptied and a new list is\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nAll fixtures and attributes that have been edited since the last Clear\r\nare stored in the ***Programmer***. The order in which you selected the\r\nfixtures is also stored, and is used with [shapes](../effects.md) and the\r\n[Fixture Overlap](cue-timing.md#setting-fade-times-and-overlap-for-a-cue)\r\nfunction. When you record a cue, the contents of the Programmer are\r\nsaved into the cue.\r\n\r\nWhen you press \\<Clear\\>, the programmer and editor are emptied. This\r\nmakes sure you don't record fixtures you don't want. You also need to\r\npress \\<Clear\\> when you finish programming, because any attributes in\r\nthe programmer will override playbacks.\r\n\r\nFixtures which are in the programmer are shown in mid blue on the [touch\r\nbuttons](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#selecting-fixtures-and-dimmers-for-control).\r\nAttributes in the programmer (the things you have changed) are\r\nshown in cyan on the [attribute displays](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#attribute-wheel-display).\r\n\r\nFiring a cue does not place the values from the cue in the programmer,\r\nso you can't just turn on a playback and record what you see to another\r\ncue *(although the Include function lets you do this, see\r\n[Using Parts of Existing Cues - the Include Function](editing-cues.md#using-parts-of-existing-cues-the-include-function))*.\r\n\r\nCreating a Cue\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/X5g6DMVwlZU?t=20 \"Creating a Cue\")\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Clear\\> to clear the programmer.\\\r\n*This ensures that you are starting with a clean slate.*\r\n\r\n2. Set up the look using the fixtures. You can save shapes in a cue.\r\nRemember that only fixtures which are selected or have been modified\r\nwill be saved in the cue (in \\[Record by Fixture\\] mode).\r\n\r\n3. Press the \\<Record\\> button *(\\<Record Cue\\> on Pearl Expert)*.\r\n\r\n4. Press the **Swop** button of an empty Playback to record the cue. The\r\nhandles where you can record the cue will flash. You can also record a\r\ncue onto a touch button in the Playbacks window.\r\n\r\n5. Press \\<Clear\\> to clear the programmer\r\n\r\nOther useful things to know about recording cues:\r\n\r\n-   Cues can be recorded to any fader, the macro/executor buttons or the\r\n    onscreen Playbacks window.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Record Mode\\] lets you select:\r\n    -   \\[Record By Fixture\\] - All attributes of any modified or selected\r\n    fixture are saved\r\n    -   \\[Record By Channel\\] - Only modified attributes are saved\r\n    -   \\[Record Stage\\] - All fixtures with a non-zero dimmer channel are saved\r\n    -   \\[Quick Build\\] - see [next section](#quick-build-cues)\r\n\r\n-   \\[Record By Channel\\] is useful if you want to layer multiple cues to\r\n    create an effect.\r\n\r\n-   If you are recording a lot of cues, you can press \\<Menu Latch\\> to\r\n    keep the Record Cue menu active. Press \\<Exit\\> to leave Record Cue\r\n    mode.\r\n\r\n-   The screen immediately above each fader shows a legend for the\r\n    playback. To set this, from the top-level menu press \\[Set Legend\\], \r\n    then the playback **Swop** button (or the touch select button), then enter a legend on the\r\n    keyboard or draw a picture legend. Press \\<Enter\\> to store it. *If\r\n    the fader or button does not have an associated screen you will have\r\n    to resort to the old fashioned method of white tape and sharpie.*\r\n\r\n![Playbacks stored on playback faders](/docs/images/Playbacks-stored-on-playback-faders.png)\r\n\r\n-   A Static Playbacks workspace is available to show the contents of\r\n    the macro/executor buttons and (on the Tiger Touch) the 10 static\r\n    playback faders.\r\n\r\nQuick Build Cues\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nSetting \\[Record Mode\\] to **Quick Build** allows you to build a cue from\r\nexisting playbacks or palettes (you can also use the\r\n[Include function](editing-cues.md#using-parts-of-existing-cues-the-include-function) to\r\ndo this).\r\n\r\nAfter setting the record mode to Quick Build, the console will wait for\r\nyou to select playbacks or palettes.\r\n\r\nTo insert specific fixtures from a palette or playback, select the\r\nfixtures first and then select the palette or playback.\r\n\r\nPress \\[OK\\] once you have selected all the playbacks or palettes\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nUsing Shapes/Effects in Cues\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nAs you would expect, any [shapes or Pixel Mapper effects](../effects.md) you have set up\r\nwill be saved as part of the cue.\r\n\r\nYou can create a cue which contains a shape with no base reference\r\nvalues; a shape cue like this can then be fired with other cues to\r\noverlay the shape on the cue and give you instant effects based around\r\nthe settings in that cue. When recording the cue, use **Record by Channel**\r\nmode or use the [\"Off\" function](editing-cues.md#removing-attributes-from-cues-using-off)\r\nto remove the other attributes from the programmer.\r\n\r\nBlind Mode\r\n----------\r\n\r\nBlind mode allows you to program cues without affecting the current look\r\non the stage. This can be very useful for making changes during a live\r\nshow. Your changes are still shown in the\r\n[Visualiser window](../capture-visualiser.md).\r\n\r\nTo put the console into blind mode, just press the \\<Blind\\> button *(on\r\nconsoles without a dedicated button, hold down \\<Avo\\> and select the\r\n\\[Blind\\] option)*.\r\n\r\nIf you want to preview a playback on the visualiser without affecting\r\nthe stage, playbacks can be set to Blind mode using \\[Playback\r\nOptions\\]. To quickly set a playback to blind mode, hold \\<Blind\\> and\r\npress the playback **select** button. Repeat to make it Live again.\r\n\r\nYou can fade your blind state to the live output by typing in a fade\r\ntime number then pressing \\<Blind\\>. This allows you to recall several\r\npalettes together, or create a live state to be output without needing\r\nto save it to a cue.\r\n\r\nRecording Cue with a Mask\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can set a mask when recording a cue so that only certain attributes\r\nare recorded, the same as you can when\r\n[recording a palette](../palettes/creating-palettes.md#storing-a-palette). In the\r\nRecord menu, select the \\[Set Mask\\] option.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional option \\[Clear Record Mask\\], if this is enabled\r\nthe mask will automatically be cleared after this record operation. This\r\nis good to stop you accidentally leaving the mask set and causing havoc\r\nwith future cues.\r\n\r\nConvert Cue to Chase or Cue List\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you want to convert an existing cue into [chase](../chases.md) or \r\n[cue list](../cue-lists.md) by adding\r\nfurther steps, press \\<Record\\>, select the cue, then select \\[Convert\r\nto Chase\\] (or Cue List). The existing cue will become cue 1 and the\r\ncontents of the programmer will become a new cue 2.",

Normally this\r\nis set to the order in which you selected the fixtures when the cue was\r\ncreated, but you might want to change this *(for example to pair up\r\nfixtures so they move together when using\r\n[Overlap](#setting-fade-times-and-overlap-for-a-cue))*.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\[Edit Times\\] at the top level menu\r\n\r\n2. Press the **Swop** button of the cue to be changed\r\n\r\n3. Press \\[Fixture Order\\]\r\n\r\n4. Set the sequence number to start from using \\[softkey A\\]\r\n\r\n5. If you want the sequence number to increase automatically, set\r\n\\[Autoincrement\\] to **On**. If you want some fixtures to have the same\r\nsequence number, set it to **Off**.\r\n\r\n6. Touch the **Select** buttons of the fixture(s) you want to place in that\r\nposition in the sequence. The sequence number is shown in the top right\r\nhand corner of the fixture select touch buttons.\r\n![Fixtures Window setting Fixture Order](/docs/images/Fixtures-Window-showing-fixture-order.png)\r\n\r\n7. Press \\<Exit\\> to finish.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n-   You can set several fixtures to have the same sequence number. This\r\n    means, for example, when used with Overlap they will all do the same\r\n    thing at the same time.\r\n\r\n-   You can remove a fixture from the sequence by turning off\r\n    \\[Autoincrement\\] and pressing the fixture button twice. The fixture\r\n    sequence will show X. Touch the button again to put it back in the\r\n    sequence.\r\n\r\nSetting Attribute Fade Times for a Cue\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can set individual fade times for each attribute group (such as\r\nPosition). If you set a time, it overrides the normal times.\r\n\r\nTo set an attribute group fade time:\r\n\r\n1. Press \\[Edit Times\\] at the top level menu\r\n\r\n2. Press the **Swop** button of the cue to be changed\r\n\r\n3. Press the Attribute Bank button (right hand side) for the attribute\r\nyou want to change\r\n\r\n4. Press \\[Delay\\] to set delay time or \\[Set fade\\] to set fade time\r\n\r\n5. Type the new time using the numeric keypad and press \\<Enter\\> to\r\nsave it, or press \\[Use Global\\] to delete the attribute times and go\r\nback to the normal times.\r\n\r\n6. Press \\<Enter\\> to save the changes.\r\n\r\nYou can take this even further and set individual fade times for each\r\nfixture. When you select the cue to be changed, you will see that all\r\nthe fixtures in the cue are selected. To set attribute times for only\r\ncertain fixtures, change the fixture selection using the **Swop** buttons.\r\n\r\nThe [Cue View window](editing-cues.md#cue-view) will display when editing cue timings to help you\r\nsee what you are editing. You can touch fixtures or attributes in the\r\ngrid to select which items are going to be edited.\r\n\r\nPress the \\<All\\> button to select all fixtures in the cue.\r\n\r\nWhen you are in the Set Attribute Times menu you can only select\r\nfixtures which are in the cue you are editing.\r\n\r\nEditing Times in the Programmer\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can check and edit the times which are set in the programmer before\r\nsaving a cue. You can also set times into the programmer and\r\n[merge](editing-cues.md#editing-a-cue-by-merging) them\r\ninto cues as a quick way of updating times, just like you would with\r\nattribute values.\r\n\r\nPress the \\<Time\\> button to access this menu.\r\n\r\n>   On Titan Mobile and Sapphire Touch, the Time button is the key above\r\n    \\<Clear\\> (previously labelled \\<Set\\>). On Pearl Expert and Tiger Touch\r\n    it is the key previously labelled \\<Next Time\\>.\r\n\r\nThe menu allows you to set cue times, or times for all attributes of a\r\nfixture, attribute groups or individual attributes.\r\n\r\n![Edit Programmer Cue Times in the Titan Go interface](/docs/images/Edit-Programmer-Cue-Times-in-the-Titan-Go-interface.png)\r\n\r\nUsing the \\<Time\\> button there are various quick shortcuts to setting\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n-   \\<Time\\> \\<5\\> = 5 sec fade in\r\n\r\n-   \\<CUE\\> \\<3\\> \\<Time\\> \\<5\\> = 5 sec fade in on connected playback's cue 3\r\n\r\n-   \\<Time\\> **FIXTURE** \\<5\\> = 5 sec fade in for all attributes of selected\r\n    fixtures\r\n\r\n-   \\<Time\\> **FIXTURE** \\<G\\> \\<5\\> = 5 sec fade in for gobo attribute group of\r\n    selected fixtures\r\n\r\n-   \\<Time\\> **FIXTURE** \\<\\@B\\> \\<5\\> = 5 sec fade in for attribute connected to wheel\r\n    B on selected fixtures\r\n\r\n-   \\<5\\> \\<@\\> \\<3\\> = 5 sec fade in, 3 sec delay\r\n\r\n-   \\<5\\> \\<AND\\> \\<2\\> = 5 sec fade in, 2 sec fade out\r\n\r\n-   \\<1\\> \\<THRO\\> \\<10\\> = times spread across fixtures according to selection\r\n    order\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/GHq9b3PT8U0?t=20 \"Timing Syntax\")\r\n\r\nIndividual attribute times can also be set from the wheels, using the\r\n\\[Wheels\\] softkey option on the root menu.\r\n\r\nUsing the \\<Options\\> button while showing the times allows you to set\r\nthe **Speed**, **Effect Multiplier**, **Speed Multiplier** and **speed source** in the\r\nprogrammer.

Touch or drag over the required control values in the grid to select\r\nthem - *they will be highlighted in blue*\r\n\r\n2.

Off temporarily removes a value from the cue, it can\r\nlater be restored using \\[On\\].\r\n\r\n5. You can remove a fixture completely from the cue by selecting the\r\nfixture then pressing the \\[Remove Fixtures\\] softkey.\r\n\r\nAny changes take immediate effect.\r\n\r\nUsing Parts of Existing Cues - the Include Function\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Include function lets you load selected parts of a cue back into the\r\nprogrammer. (Normally, only manual changes to fixtures are put in the\r\nprogrammer). You can then use this to make a new cue. This is useful if\r\nyou want to make a cue which is similar to one you already have, or to\r\nbuild a new cue from various parts of other cues. It's also useful when\r\nediting shapes in cues.\r\n\r\nThere are two modes, **Quick Include** and **Advanced Include**. Quick Include\r\nsimply reloads the whole cue. Advanced Include allows you to specify\r\nwhich attributes of which fixtures you want to load into the programmer.\r\nSo, for example, if you have a cue which contains position, colour and\r\ngobo information for 8 fixtures, you can use the include function to\r\nload only the colour information for 4 of the fixtures into the\r\nprogrammer. You could then Include position information from another cue\r\ninto the programmer, and build up a new cue using information from\r\nseveral existing cues.\r\n\r\nIf you Include a [chase](../chases.md) or [cue list](../cue-lists.md), the screen shows you a list of the\r\ncues within it, and you select the one you want to Include using Wheel A\r\nor by touching the cue. You can also type in the cue number to Include.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Include\\>.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Quick Include\\] or \\[Advanced mode\\] if you want to change\r\nthe mode.\r\n\r\n3. Press the **Swop** button of the cue you want to include into the\r\nprogrammer. If you are in **Quick Include** mode, this Includes the cue and\r\nfinishes.\r\n\r\n4. If you are in **Advanced Include**, all fixtures in the cue will be\r\nselected. If you don't want them all, deselect the fixtures you don't\r\nwant. The fixtures in the cue are highlighted on the screen and on the\r\nfixture buttons.\r\n\r\n5. Use \\[Set Mask\\] or the Attribute Bank buttons to select which\r\nAttributes you want to include *(all are included by default - \\[Softkey C\\]\r\nturns them all off and \\[Softkey D\\] turns them all on)*. \\[Softkey E\\] lets you include\r\nor exclude Shapes from the cue.\r\n\r\n6. Press \\<Enter\\>. The selected attributes of the selected fixtures\r\nwill be loaded into the programmer.\r\n\r\n7. **Repeat steps 2 - 6** to include other attributes from the same fixtures, or\r\n**repeat steps 1 - 6** to include other fixtures.\r\n\r\n>   In **Quick Include** mode, you can set a mask for the include by\r\n    pressing one or more of the attribute bank buttons before you select\r\n    the cue to include.\r\n\r\nRemoving Attributes from Cues Using \"Off\"\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/p7Ffz4e4tws?t=20 \"Off\")\r\n\r\nThe \\<Off\\> button allows you to remove an attribute which has been\r\nstored in a cue, as if you'd never recorded it.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose you recorded a cue which had fixtures at a certain\r\nposition, with the colour set to green. If you later decide that you\r\ndon't want a colour recorded at all in the cue, so that the playback\r\nwill position the fixtures but leave the colour set by previous\r\nplaybacks, you set the colour values to Off in the programmer, which\r\nwhen saved will remove those values from the cue. You can also use the\r\nOff function to remove complete fixtures from a cue.\r\n\r\nSetting an attribute to **Off** is not the same as recording an attribute at\r\nzero, since this would change the attribute when the cue was fired. It\r\nis the same as excluding that attribute using the mask when recording,\r\nso the attribute will remain unchanged when the cue is fired.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Off\\>, then \\[Off Playback Values\\] followed by the playback\r\nto be changed.\r\n\r\n2. All fixtures in the playback will automatically select. If you only\r\nwant to change some fixtures to **Off**, change the selection.\r\n\r\n3. By default the attribute mask is set so all attributes will be\r\nchanged to Off. Press \\[Set Mask\\] to choose which attributes will be\r\nset to **Off**.\r\n\r\n4. Press the \\[Off\\] softkey\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou can also use \\<Include\\> to set values to Off.\r\n\r\n1. Use the **Quick Include** function (described in [previous section](#using-parts-of-existing-cues-the-include-function)) to\r\nload the cue you want to change into the programmer.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\<Off\\> to display the Off menu.\r\n\r\n3. All fixtures in the cue will be selected. If you don't want to\r\nchange them all, deselect the fixtures you don't want.\r\n\r\n4. Use the Attribute Bank buttons to toggle which attributes you want\r\nto change. Then press the \\[Attributes Off\\] softkey to set them to Off.\r\nThe bottom softkeys also give options such as \\[Dimmer Off\\].\r\n\r\n5. Press \\<Record\\>, then set the record mode to \\[Replace\\], and press\r\nthe **Swop** button of the cue to update it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n-   To turn off all attributes of all selected fixtures, press \\<Off\\>\r\n    then \\[Selected Fixtures Off\\].\r\n\r\n-   You can **merge** *\"Off\"* attributes into a cue without including it\r\n    first.\r\n\r\n-   You can also remove attributes from palettes using the **Off** function.\r\n\r\n-   Another way to remove attributes is from the [Cue View window](#cue-view).\r\n\r\n-   Attributes set to **Off** can be restored to their previous value using\r\n    the **On** function. Set the attribute to **On** and **merge** it into the cue",

These are called **HTP** and **LTP** rules.\r\n\r\nCombining Cues with HTP and LTP\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nControl channels are handled in two ways:\r\n\r\n-   Dimmer or intensity channels work on the principle of **\"Highest Takes\r\n    Precedence\" (HTP)**. If an HTP channel is active at different levels\r\n    in several cues, the highest level will be output. When you fade out\r\n    a cue, the HTP channels fade out with it.\r\n\r\n-   All other channels work on the principle of **\"Latest Takes\r\n    Precedence\" (LTP)**. The latest change takes over from any other\r\n    values, so the most recent cue to be turned on is the one which is\r\n    output. When you fade out a cue, LTP channels retain their values\r\n    until changed by another cue.\r\n\r\nPlaying Back a Cue\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nTo fire (play back) a cue, raise the fader. (Make sure there are no\r\nvalues in the programmer by pressing the \\<Clear\\> button, because anything\r\nin the programmer will override the playback).\r\n\r\n-   You can fire several cues at once.\r\n\r\n-   The HTP levels in the cue will be mastered by the fader level; for\r\n    example if you set the fader at 50% then all HTP levels will be 50%\r\n    of their programmed values.\r\n\r\n-   LTP channels are triggered as soon as the fader goes above 0%. If a\r\n    fade time is programmed the LTP channels will start to fade; if\r\n    there is no fade time they will snap to position *(unless the cue is\r\n    set to Mode 2 in which case they fade with the fader position; see\r\n    the timings section [Fader Modes](cue-timing.md#fade-modes) for details of modes)*.\r\n\r\n-   You can **Flash** the cue by pressing the grey flash button. You can\r\n    **Swop** (solo) the cue by pressing the blue Swop button (all other\r\n    active cues will turn off while the button is pressed). This assumes\r\n    you haven't reassigned the function of the buttons using\r\n    [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md), see below.\r\n\r\n-   You can **Preload** the cue by assigning the Preload function to the\r\n    blue or grey buttons using\r\n    [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md). Preload sets the attributes\r\n    of fixtures in the playback which are not currently active in any\r\n    other playbacks. *This is useful to avoid the fixtures visibly moving\r\n    into position or changing colours or gobos when you raise the fader\r\n    of the cue.*\\\r\n    To assign Preload, hold \\<Avo\\> Shift and press \\[Edit\r\n    Key Profile\\], then press the button you want to assign (also see\r\n    [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md)). Note that this will assign the function\r\n    to all buttons of the same type.\r\n\r\n-   You can fire a one-shot cue with timings by assigning the Go\r\n    function to one of the handle buttons using\r\n    [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md). This\r\n    allows you to fire the cue without needing to hold down a button\r\n    while the timing completes. You can also fire the cue again without\r\n    needing to release it.\r\n\r\n-   You can set playbacks to high **priority** if you do not want them to be\r\n    overridden by other playbacks using the same fixtures. For example,\r\n    if you have a couple of fixtures acting as a spotlight, but they are\r\n    also programmed into some colour washes, you probably want the\r\n    spotlight cue to take priority over the colour washes. See \r\n    [Priority](playback-options.md#priority) in\r\n    playback [Options](playback-options.md).\r\n\r\nChanging Playback Pages\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe console allows multiple pages of playbacks. Page buttons are\r\nprovided near the faders or you can also touch the top and bottom of the\r\nroller graphic on the screen. If you touch the middle of the roller\r\ngraphic you can jump to a page number by entering the number.\r\n\r\n>   If you have stored cues on the touch select buttons, you select\r\n    different pages using the Playbacks page touch buttons.\r\n\r\n",

You can also press \\[Playback\r\nOptions\\] followed by the playback in this window to change parameters\r\nof the playback.\r\n\r\nSpeed and Size Masters\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nPlaybacks can be assigned to Speed and Size Masters which allow you to\r\nmodify the speed and size of [shapes or effects](../effects.md) stored in a cue using a\r\nseparate master fader (or in the case of chases, to \r\n[modify the speed of the chase](../chases/chase-timing.md#rate-and-bpm-masters)).\r\n*This is really useful to modify the look when several\r\nplaybacks are running at the same time.*\r\n\r\nYou can also assign the fader of the playback the effect is stored in to\r\ncontrol shape speed or size using the [Fader\r\nSettings](playback-options.md#fader-tab) in playback [Options](playback-options.md).\r\n\r\nSee [Speed and Size Masters](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#speed-and-size-masters)\r\nfor more details.\r\n\r\nReleasing Running Playbacks\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can **release** a running playback to its previous state by pressing\r\n\\<Release\\> *(\\<Off\\> button on Pearl Expert)*, then the **select** button of\r\nthe playback to be released. Channels will release back to their state\r\nin the previous playback until no playbacks are left to be released. If\r\nthe \\[Release to Home\\] setting on the Release menu is Enabled, channels\r\nwill go to the power-on state, which you can program (see \r\n[next section](#programming-the-release-power-on-state)).\r\nIf the option is disabled, channels will remain in the state of the last\r\nplayback. You can release all running playbacks by pressing \\<Release\\>\r\nthen \\[Release all playbacks\\].\r\n\r\nYou can also configure the key profile so that the blue or grey buttons\r\ncan be used to release the playback using [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md).\r\n\r\nChannels will always release with a fade time, this defaults to 2\r\nseconds but you can change it using \\[Master Release Time\\] in the\r\nRelease menu. You can also set an individual release time for the\r\nplayback from the [Release tab](playback-options.md#release-tab) of playback [Options](playback-options.md).\r\n\r\n-   You can instantly kill a playback by pressing \\<Avo\\> + the **swop**\r\n    button of the playback.\r\n\r\n-   You can set a mask so that only certain attributes release from the\r\n    playback when the playback is killed. This uses the \r\n    [\\[Release Mask\\] option](playback-options.md#release-mask) in \r\n    playback [Options](playback-options.md).\r\n    Normally all attributes will remain in the state last used in the\r\n    playback - *for cues which trigger strobing or other effects this\r\n    might not be what you want*.\r\n\r\nReleasing a Whole Page of Playbacks\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can use the Release function to release a whole page of playbacks in\r\none operation. Press \\<Release\\> then the \\<Goto Page\\> button, or touch\r\nthe current page in the playbacks view. You will get the following\r\noptions:\r\n\r\n\\[Release this Page\\] - releases all active playbacks on the current page\r\nand playback fader group\r\n\r\n\\[Release Playbacks Not On This Page\\] - releases any active playback on\r\nthe same fader group from another page\r\n\r\n\\[Release All Playbacks In This Group\\] - releases any active playback in\r\nthe fader group.\r\n\r\n> **\"Fader Group\"** refers to a particular area of the console, for example\r\nthe main faders below the screen on a Tiger Touch or the top row on the\r\nleft hand side of the Arena.\r\n\r\nRelease Mask\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou can release individual fixtures or attributes, and remove fixtures\r\nfrom shapes in playbacks using the release mask. There is a Global\r\nrelease mask which affects all release operations, or you can set a\r\nLocal release mask which affects only the current playback.\r\n\r\n",

You can store in several places:\r\n\r\n-   On any **fader handle** - the fader controls the intensity of\r\n    fixtures (you can make the fader control other things using playback\r\n    [Options](cues/playback-options.md)).\r\n\t\r\n-\tOn a **Virtual fader** in the [Virtual faders](running-the-show/playback-controls.md#virtual-faders) window on the touchscreen.

All fixtures currently\r\nincluded in the shape will be selected. You can select or deselect\r\nfixtures to add or remove them from the shape.\r\n\r\nIf a fixture group was used to create the shape, removing fixtures from\r\nthe shape using this option will break the link to the group. A \\[Remove\r\nFixtures\\] confirmation softkey will be shown to warn you of this.\r\n\r\nReversing a Shape\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nYou can reverse the direction of a shape by pressing \\[Reverse Selected\r\nFixtures\\] from the shape menu. The shape will be reversed only on\r\nfixtures which are selected, allowing you to run the shape forward on\r\nsome fixtures and backwards on others.\r\n\r\nDeleting Shapes\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nYou can delete a running shape by pressing \\[Delete\\] from the shape\r\nmenu, then pressing the \\[softkey\\] for the shape you want to delete.",

To add another layer, click the **plus** button at the\r\nbottom, then select **Layers**. The new layer will appear in the list on the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n![Effect Editor adding an extra effect](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-adding-an-extra-effect.png)\r\n\r\nYou can also add a completely separate key frame shape or a\r\n[pixel map effect](pixel-mapper.md).\r\nPixel map effects will be shown at the top of the shape list on\r\nthe left, you can use the **eye** icon to hide the pixel map effect when you\r\nwant to work on the key frame shapes.\r\n\r\nSaving a Key Frame Shape to a Cue\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nBy default when a key frame shape is saved to a cue, the playback fader\r\nwill fade the shape. If the playback is set to have\r\n[Speed on Fader](../cues/playback-options.md#shape-effect-speed), the\r\nfader will master the speed of all layers in the shape.\r\n\r\nWhen a key frame shape is running in a playback it can behave as Overlay\r\nor LTP. A global value for\r\n[Shape Behaviour](../system-settings/user-settings.md#shape-behaviour) is in the\r\n[User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md), but\r\nyou can also set the mode in\r\nplayback [Options](../cues/playback-options.md#shape-behaviour) for each playback.\r\n\r\n-   In \\[Overlay\\] mode (default) the shape will have control of the\r\n    programmed attributes regardless of whatever else you do. For\r\n    example if a key frame shape is controlling fixture colour, firing\r\n    another playback, recalling palettes or changing colour using the\r\n    wheels will have no visible effect. Once the shape is stopped, the\r\n    changes you made will become visible. This means that if you want to\r\n    you can preset what will happen when you stop the shape.\r\n\r\n-   In \\[LTP\\] mode, changes of the same or higher priority will override\r\n    the shape output. For example if your key frame shape is set to\r\n    normal priority, firing a playback with normal priority will block\r\n    the shape output. Killing the playback will restore the shape\r\n    output. Quick Palettes and manual changes (the programmer) have High\r\n    priority. Setting the shape priority to **\"Very High\"** would prevent\r\n    the programmer taking over (see\r\n    [Priority](../cues/playback-options.md#priority) in\r\n    playback [Options](../cues/playback-options.md)).\r\n\r\nFor details of how Key Frame Shapes behave in Cue Lists, see\r\n[Shape Tracking in Cue Lists](../cue-lists/creating-a-cue-list.md#shape-tracking-in-cue-lists).\r\n\r\n- If you create a Mask Shape using the [Mask FX function](shape-generator.md#masking-shapes-using-mask-fx), this will also stop Key Frame Shape",

For example you might have 20x Colourblocks across\r\nfour towers, each with five blocks.\r\n\r\n1. Select the fixtures and create a group\r\n\r\n2. Open the **Layout Editor**\r\n\r\n3. Select **Arrange Fixtures** from the context menu\r\n\r\n4. Select the \\[Height\\] softkey and type \\<5\\>\\\r\n*Width will automatically be calculated*\r\n\r\n5. Toggle \\[Crop Grid to fixtures\\] so that it is highlighted\\\r\n*This will make the grid adjust to fit*\r\n\r\n6. Toggle \\[Arrange in...\\] to **Columns** or **Rows**\\\r\n**Rows** will arrange fixtures left to right and **Columns** will arrange top to\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n7. The \\[Shape\\] option allows you to arrange in Rectangle, Oval or\r\nTriangle\r\n\r\n8. Select \\[OK\\] to complete\r\n\r\n**Highlight:** When enabled this will highlight selected fixtures live\r\non stage. This can be useful to see which fixture you are positioning in\r\nthe layout.\r\n\r\n**Position & Angle/Cell Scale:** When set to 'Position & Angle' the\r\nwheels move and rotate the fixtures. When set to 'Cell Scale' the wheels\r\nchange the size of the fixture by spreading out its cells. This is\r\nuseful to get the correct layout if you have some large fixtures with\r\nwidely spaced cells and others with cells close together.\r\n\r\n**Arrange/Select Only:** When set to **Arrange** you can move fixtures by\r\nclicking and dragging on the screen. When set to **Select Only**\r\nfixtures are locked in position on the grid and cannot be dragged\r\naround. This provides an alternative way of selecting fixtures to edit\r\nwhile preventing accidental movement.\r\n\r\n*If you find you suddenly cannot move anything around this is probably\r\nthe reason!*\r\n\r\nFor either setting you can still use the wheels to move and rotate the\r\nfixtures.\r\n\r\n**Wheels Move Full Pixel/Sub Pixel:** Allows you to position fixtures\r\nacross pixel boundaries when using the wheels. The **Snap** option\r\ncentres the fixture on the nearest cell.\r\n\r\n**Wheels Rotate Individual Fixtures/Selection:** Sets whether individual\r\nfixtures rotate, or whether the whole selection rotates.\r\n\r\n**Media options:** Shows a sub menu with useful options when you're\r\nusing Synergy/Ai to play back media on the fixture. These options are\r\ndescribed in [Layout Editor with Ai Server](../synergy/operating-synergy.md#layout-editor-with-ai-server).\r\n\r\nPlayback Order and Priorities\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nSuppose you wished to create a white pulsating oval on one playback and\r\na blue spiral on a second playback. Normally these effects would layer\r\ndifferently depending on the order you fire the playbacks, but you can\r\nuse playback priorities to make them always layer the same way\r\n\r\nTo create first effect:\r\n\r\n1. Select a group containing a fixture layout as described in previous\r\nexample and go to \\[Create Effect\\]\r\n\r\n2.

Double-click on \\[Circle\\] (or press \\[+\\]) and select the **Zoom**\r\nanimation\r\n\r\n    Drag **In Time** to 0% and **Out Time** to 100%.

Alternatively the same effect can\r\n    be created by making **Start Zoom** larger than **End Zoom**.)\r\n\r\n    Increase **End Zoom** until the element begins by filling the whole\r\n    window.\r\n\r\n5. Double-click on \\[Zoom Animation\\] (or press \\[+\\]) and select the\r\n**Opacity animation**\r\n\r\n    Reduce **Spawn Rate** to zero. (This will ensure the opacity only works\r\n    on the zoom animation.)\r\n\r\n    Drag **In Time** to 0% and **Out Time** to 100. (This will make the\r\n    effect snap on and fade out as it reduces in size. As with zoom you can\r\n    achieve much the same thing by inverting the opacity controls instead.\r\n    Using opacity values greater than 100% will create a delay before\r\n    fade.)\r\n\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Opacity Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Opacity-Animation-Settings.png)\r\n\r\n6.

(This will make the lines of the\r\n    spiral stay the same width. A negative value means the spiral gets\r\n    thinner towards the outside; a positive value means it gets thinner\r\n    towards the inside.)\r\n\r\n    Reduce **Turns** so we can make a more bold effect. Approx. 3 should\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n    Increase **Thickness** to **50%** for chunky lines.\r\n\r\n    Increase **Exponent** to around **25%**. (This causes the spiral to\r\n    **expand** at a faster rate.)\r\n    \r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Modifying a Spiral](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Modifying-a-Spiral.png)\r\n\r\n4.

That is\r\nbecause the playbacks are following a **latest takes precedence** rule\r\n(LTP).\r\n\r\nTo guarantee the blue spiral always sits on top you can set it to be a\r\nhigher priority:\r\n\r\n1. Kill both effects\r\n\r\n2. Press \\<Options\\> (or \\[Options\\] from the top level menu) - see [Playback Options](../cues/playback-options.md)\r\n\r\n3. **Select** the blue spiral playback\r\n\r\n4. Press \\[Previous\\] or \\[Next\\] until you can see \\[Priority Normal\\]\r\n    on the softkeys. Press this to toggle it to \\[Priority High\\].\r\n\r\n5. Now fire the blue spiral followed by the white pulse.\r\n\r\nEven though you fired them in the same order as the first example the\r\nblue spiral now sits on top of the white pulse because it has a higher\r\npriority.\r\n\r\nDisplacement and Layer Properties\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn this example we create random flashing bars, and use layer controls\r\nto make global adjustments to the whole effect.\r\n\r\n1. Create a group and adjust the fixture layout as described in\r\nprevious examples\r\n\r\n2. Select this group and begin creating an effect\r\n\r\n3. Select \\[Layer 1\\] and add a **Block** element.\r\n\r\n4. Adjust the **width** and **height** sliders until we have a thin strip that\r\ncovers at least one cell vertically and the whole grid horizontally.\r\n\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Adjusting Width and Height of a Block](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Adjusting-Width-and-Height-of-a-Block.png)\r\n\r\n5. Reduce **Y** until the bar disappears off the top of the grid. (This is\r\nin preparation for adding a displacement animation.)\r\n\r\n6. Add a **Displacement animation**. By default this will offset the\r\noriginal position by anything up to 30% distance. This is because the\r\ndefault value for **Distance** is set to a maximum of 30% and **Distance\r\nRandom** is set to 100% meaning it can use any random value between zero\r\nand 30%. Similarly **Direction Random** is set to 100% meaning it can\r\noffset in any direction.\r\n\r\n    Temporarily set **Distance Random** to 0%. (This is in order to see\r\n    exactly what the displacement is doing.)\r\n\r\n    Set **Direction Random** to 0 degrees. (In this example we do not require a\r\n    random direction.) Now the bar will disappear because it is being\r\n    displaced upwards in the default settings.\r\n\r\n    Set **Direction** to 180 degrees. Click on the compass button four times\r\n    to get there quickly. Now the bar should reappear on the screen because\r\n    it has been offset vertically down from the our off-screen position by\r\n    the default 30%.\r\n\r\n    Increase **Distance** until the bar is approximately in the centre.\\\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Displacement Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Displacement-Animation-Settings.png)\r\n\r\n7. Add an **Opacity animation**\r\n\r\n    Reduce **In Time** and **Out Time** to create a snapping effect.\\\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Opacity Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Opacity-Animation-Settings-2.png)\r\n\r\n8. Click on **Displacement** in the Layer to get back to the controls\r\nfor this animation again.\r\n\r\n    Now increase **Distance Random** to 100%. (This will make the bar draw\r\n    at a random offset around the **Distance** setting, in this case making\r\n    it anywhere within the grid.)\r\n\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Displacement Animation Direction Random Setting](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Displacement-Animation-Direction-Random-Setting.png)\r\n\r\n9. Return to the **Opacity animation** controls and increase speed until\r\nyou're happy.  \r\nAt this point you may decide actually the effect would be better if\r\nit was a vertical bar. To make this easy we can make adjustments on the\r\nlayer controls rather than on the individual element and animations:\r\n\r\n10. Select \\[Layer 1\\] to bring up the layer controls.\r\n\r\n11. Change **Rotation** to 90 degrees by clicking on the compass button\r\ntwice.\\\r\n![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Changing Layer Rotation](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Changing-Layer-Rotation.png)\r\n\r\nNow you have a vertical bar that draws randomly using a horizontal\r\ndisplacement. Similarly you can use the \\[layer\\] or \\[effect\\] controls\r\nto make global changes to **X/Y position** and **Zoom** allowing quick\r\nmanipulation of entire effects.\r\n\r\nSpawn and Pre-Spool\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe director has asked for lots of animated spinning shurikens that\r\nslowly move across a backdrop while pulsating. It is a mystery why, but\r\nyou know how it is with directors.\r\n\r\n1. Select a group with an appropriate layout\r\n\r\n2. Add a **Star** element\r\n\r\n    Change **Points** to 4 for a classic shuriken.\r\n\r\n    Reduce **Zoom** so that we can fit lots of baby shurikens in the grid.\r\n\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Modifying a Star Element](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Modifying-a-Star-Element.png)\r\n\r\n3. Add a **Spin animation**\r\n\r\n    Reduce **Speed** so they are relatively harmless.\r\n\r\n4. Add a **Linear Movement animation**\r\n\r\n    Slow it down so it looks like it is rolling along.\r\n\r\n5. Select the Star element again and change **X** so the shuriken\r\nstarts further from the left and rolls along the whole grid.\r\n\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Transforming Star Element](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Transforming-Star-Element.png)\r\n\r\n6. Add a **Displacement animation**\r\n\r\n    Now each new shuriken starts rolling at a different height on the grid.\r\n\r\n7. Go back to the Linear Movement animation and increase **Spawn Rate**\r\nso that more shurikens are on screen at once. (This determines how\r\nfrequently a new element appears.)\r\n\r\n    Increase **Direction Random** slightly. (This will allow a random\r\n    variation in the direction of travel based upon the **Direction**\r\n    value.)\r\n\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Linear Movement Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Linear-Movement-Settings.png)\r\n\r\n8. Add a **Zoom animation**\r\n\r\n    Reduce **Spawn Rate** to 0%. (This is a special setting that will\r\n    allow the zoom animation to run continuously during the life of a\r\n    shuriken. If the rate is set to 1 it will only run once and the\r\n    shurikens will quickly disappear as a result.)\r\n\r\n    Increase **Out Time** to 100%. (This will make the shurikens pulse in\r\n    and out with a **bounce** type effect. I have no idea why they would be\r\n    doing this in reality.)\r\n\r\n    Slow the zoom down a bit.\r\n\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Zoom Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Zoom-Animation-Settings.png)\r\n\r\n9. Click on \\[Effect\\] and set **Pre-Spool** to 0%\\\r\n*This is to demonstrate the purpose of the property.*\r\n\r\n    ![Effect Editor - Pixel Mapper - Zoom Animation Settings](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Pixel-Mapper-Zoom-Animation-Settings-2.png)\r\n\r\n10. \\<Record\\> to a playback\r\n\r\n11. Press clear, open the **Pixel Mapper Preview** workspace and fire the\r\ncue\r\n\r\n    You will notice that initially there are no shurikens on the screen and\r\n    it takes a while to build up to a nice random collection. To fix that we\r\n    can use **Pre-Spool**.\r\n\r\n12. \\<Include\\> the cue and open the **Effect Editor** workspace if it is not\r\nalready open\r\n\r\n13. Select \\[Effect\\] and increase the **Pre-Spool** value to around\r\n20s. (This means the software will pretend 20 seconds has already\r\nelapsed when the effect is started.)\r\n\r\n14. \\<Record\\> to a playback, \\<Clear\\>, fire and view again in the **Pixel Mapper\r\nPreview**\r\n\r\n    This time there should already be plenty of shurikens on screen.\r\n    Pre-Spool is particularly useful for animations that rely on high spawn\r\n    rates but run at a low spe",

A circle shape, for example, applied\r\nto the pan and tilt attributes, would cause the fixture to move its beam\r\nin a circular pattern around its current position. You can set the size\r\nof the circle and the speed of the circle movement.\r\n\r\nShapes are most useful when used with a group of fixtures. You can then choose to\r\neither apply the shape identically to all the fixtures, or offset them\r\nso that the shape runs along the fixtures creating *\"wave\"* or *\"ballyhoo\"*\r\ntype effects (called the **Spread** or **Phase** of the shape). This allows\r\nyou to very quickly create impressive light shows.\r\n\r\nIn addition to position shapes, there are a large number of other shapes\r\navailable in Titan. The shapes are defined for a particular attribute\r\nsuch as colour, dimmer, focus and so on.\r\n\r\nTitan also has a **Mask FX** function which lets you mask out certain\r\nshapes, preventing them from appearing on the lights. For example, if\r\nsome fixtures are running a Circle shape, and then a playback is fired\r\nwhich has a Position Mask Shape programmed for some of the fixtures, those fixtures\r\nwill stop running the circle shape. This can be very useful to modify\r\nplaybacks at showtime.

You can reduce the Size to zero (see\r\n    [next section](#changing-size-and-speed-of-a-shape)) to help you\r\n    see what the base value actually is.\r\n\r\n-   You can run more than one shape at a time by repeating the above\r\n    procedure. You can run several shapes on one fixture and the output\r\n    will combine in interesting ways.\r\n\r\n-   Press \\[Shapes and Effects\\], \\[Shape Generator\\] then \\[Edit\\] to\r\n    show what shapes are running.\r\n\r\n-   If you apply the same shape to two different groups of fixtures, the\r\n    shape will appear twice on the shape list. You can edit the two\r\n    shapes separately to give different directions, speeds etc (see\r\n    [later](#changing-size-and-speed-of-a-shape))\r\n\r\n-   If the selected fixture has subfixtures (cells) then you will be\r\n    given the option to run the shape on the main fixture, keeping all\r\n    cells identical, or spread across the subfixtures/cells. The options\r\n    are:\r\n    -   \\[Run on Super Fixtures\\] - cells are ignored, fixture operates as one\r\n    block\r\n    -   \\[Run on Sub Fixtures (Linear)\\] - the cells are used in numerical order\r\n    -   \\[Run on Sub Fixtures (Group)\\] - the layout of the cells is used as\r\n    programmed in the [Layout Editor](../controlling-fixtures/fixture-groups.md#fixture-order-and-fixture-layout-in-groups) for the group\r\n\r\n-   Each shape is designed to work on a particular attribute. Obviously\r\n    if the fixtures don't have the attribute, you will not see any\r\n    effect if you use the shape.\r\n\r\n-   Each shape has a default size and speed setting *(defined in the\r\n    shape file)*.\r\n\r\n> When using a Rainbow colour shape, to get the full range of colours you need to set the CMY or RGB attributes to **50%**.\r\n\r\nChanging Size and Speed of a Shape\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is easy to change the size and speed of a shape after it has first\r\nbeen created. If the display above the wheels is showing Spread and\r\nOffset rather than Size/Speed, press \\[Adjust Speed, Size and Spread\\].\r\n\r\n![Shape Wheel Attribute Controls for Speed, Size & Spread](/docs/images/Shape-Wheel-Attribute-Controls-for-Speed-Size-Spread.png)\r\n\r\n-   Control the speed of the shape using the left hand wheel\r\n\r\n-   Control the size of the shape using the middle wheel *(right hand\r\nwheel on Pearl Expert)*\r\n\r\n-   The size and speed is shown above the wheels on the display\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther things to know about size and speed of shapes:\r\n\r\n-   If you have more than one shape running, the controls operate on the\r\n    most recent one. You can edit the parameters of any shape that's\r\n    running using the Edit Shape function, see\r\n    [Editing a Shape in a Cue Using Include](editing-shapes-and-effects.md#editing-a-shape-in-a-cue-using-include).\r\n\r\n-   The minimum size is zero. This will *\"hide\"* the shape, and the\r\n    fixture will resume its previous settings. The shape is, however,\r\n    still active.\r\n\r\n-   Once a shape is saved in a playback, you can use the playback fader\r\n    or a separate\r\n    [Speed or Size master](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#speed-and-size-masters)\r\n    to control the speed and size.\r\n\r\nChanging the Spread of a Shape Across Multiple Fixtures\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nShapes get more interesting (and look more impressive) when you apply\r\nthem to multiple fixtures. You can control how a shape is spread across\r\nseveral fixtures. You can also control Phase, which is a different way\r\nof selecting the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of the shape across the fixtures is controlled by the order\r\nin which you selected the fixtures when you created the shape. You can\r\nedit the order by selecting \\[Fixture Order\\] in the Shape Edit menu.\r\n\r\n1. If the right hand wheel isn't showing Spread, press \\[Adjust Speed,\r\nSize and Spread\\]\r\n\r\n2. Control the **Spread** of the shape using the right hand wheel, or to\r\nset in terms of Phase, press \\[Adjust Spread, Phase and Offset\\] and\r\nuse the middle wheel *(right hand wheel on Pearl Expert)*.\r\n\r\nSpread = **12** *(Phase = 30 degrees)*:\r\n\r\n![Capture Visualiser with a shape running across fixtures with spread of 12](/docs/images/Capture-Visualiser-with-a-shape-running-across-fixtures-with-spread-of-12.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSpread = **6** *(Phase = 60 degrees)*:\r\n\r\n![Capture Visualiser with a shape running across fixtures with spread of 6](/docs/images/Capture-Visualiser-with-a-shape-running-across-fixtures-with-spread-of-6.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSpread = **2** *(Phase = 180 degrees)*:\r\n\r\n![Capture Visualiser with a shape running across fixtures with spread of 2](/docs/images/Capture-Visualiser-with-a-shape-running-across-fixtures-with-spread-of-2.png)\r\n\r\nIn **Phase** mode, the display above the wheel shows the phase in degrees.\r\nFor example, 180 degrees repeats every 2 fixtures, 90 degrees repeats\r\nevery 4 fixtures, 60 degrees repeats every 6 fixtures, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe **Offset** function allows you to set the starting phase of the shape,\r\nwhen more than one shape is running. *For example, if you were running a\r\nCyan shape and a Magenta shape to create a mix of colours, you would\r\nprobably want to start them with Cyan at full and Magenta at zero to\r\ngive the full range of colours. In this case you would set one of the\r\nshapes to have a Phase Offset of 180 degrees.* Without the phase offset,\r\nboth shapes would reach full at the same time.\r\n\r\nShape Direction\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe \\[Direction\\] softkey opens a menu allowing you to set a direction\r\nfor the shape. If you have defined a\r\n[2D layout for the group](../controlling-fixtures/fixture-groups.md#fixture-order-and-fixture-layout-in-groups)\r\nthis allows you to have shapes that visibly\r\nmove in particular directions.\r\n\r\nYou can keep the shape direction menu open using the \\<Menu Latch\\>\r\nbutton, to allow you to try different options and see the effects.\r\n\r\nBeat and Cycles\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe \\[Adjust Beat and Cycles\\] option lets you set on the wheels how the\r\nprogrammed speed will trigger the shape, and how many times the shape\r\nwill run.\r\n\r\n",

This is\r\nreally useful to synchronise different types of shapes which are running\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nClicking the middle of the wheel roller image on screen or pressing \\<@A\\>\r\nfor **Wheel A** allows you to type in a number for the Beats parameter, and\r\nalso shows two further options for Beats: \\[Match to Spread\\] sets the\r\nbeat count to be the same as the current Spread setting for the shape.\r\nThis is useful when using dimmer shapes with movement shapes as it will\r\nmake each fixture turn on for a full cycle of the movement shape.

If you set a fixed number, the shape will stop by\r\nitself after that number of cycles.\r\n\r\nYou can type in a number instead of using the wheels by clicking the\r\nmiddle of the wheel roller image on screen or pressing \\<@B\\> for **Wheel B**. If\r\nyou are typing in a number you can enter part cycles, for example 1.5.\r\n\r\nUsing Shapes in Cues\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you save a shape into a cue, you can set the playback fader to\r\ncontrol the size and/or speed of the shape in\r\nplayback [Options](../cues/playback-options.md) to give you more options at\r\nshow time; you can also control the size and speed from separate\r\n[Size Master and Speed Master faders](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#speed-and-size-masters).\r\n\r\nYou can use shapes in a cue list, see\r\n[Shape Tracking in Cue Lists](../cue-lists/creating-a-cue-list.md#shape-tracking-in-cue-lists)\r\non how the shapes will behave as you go from cue to cue.\r\n\r\nYou can also adjust parameters of the shape at playback time using the\r\n\\[Select Shape\\] menu, which is on the \\[Edit\\] menu of the Shape Generator\r\nmenu.\r\n\r\nMasking shapes using Mask FX\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nIt is often useful to be able to partially or completely stop a running shape, for example\r\nto freeze the look at the end of a song or to modify the look for different moments.\r\n\r\nThe \\[Mask Fx\\] softkey on the Shapes and Effects menu allows you to record a mask which will\r\nstop shapes (both normal shapes and key frame shapes). The mask can be set to stop all shapes on all fixtures, or only shapes controlling certain attributes. You \r\ncan also select certain fixtures for the mask and leave other fixtures unaffected.\r\n\r\nTo create a mask:\r\n\r\n1.\tPress \\[Mask Fx\\] on the Shapes and Effects menu.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Attribute Bank buttons (Position, Colour etc) will flash. Choose which attributes you want to mask\r\n\tby toggling the buttons on and off.\r\n\t\r\n3.\tIf no fixtures are selected the mask will apply to all fixtures. If you only want it to apply to certain fixtures, select them now.\r\n\r\n4.\tPress \\[Create Mask Shape\\]. (The \\[Create Mask FX\\] button will mask both shapes and pixel map effects.)\r\n\r\n5.\tYou should see the mask taking effect on the output - if you store it in a playback, the playback\r\n\twill stop the shapes it's set to mask while it is active.\r\n\t\r\n- The \\[Clear mask from programmer\\] button will remove any mask shapes or mask effects from the programmer for all fixtures.\r\n\r\n- This function replaces the **Block Shapes** function of previous versions. Shows containing Block Shapes from previous versions\r\n  will load and work as expected, but the block shapes will be renamed \"Mask\".\r\n\r\n- The personality library may need updating for this to work. \r\n\r\nStoring Shapes in Palettes\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can create palettes containing shapes. This is really useful to\r\nquickly call back shapes pre-configured with different spread and speed\r\nsettings.

When\r\nyou patch each fixture, you tell the console which personality to use\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nThe console holds a personality library containing all commonly used\r\nfixtures, but new fixtures are appearing all the time and Avolites are\r\nconstantly updating the library.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you should update the library from time to time to\r\ntake advantage of new fixtures, as well as receiving bug fixes for\r\npersonalities and new features which may be added such as subfixtures.\r\n\r\nDownloading fixture personalities from Avolites\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe [Avolites website](https://personalities.avolites.com/) lists all fixtures for which personalities have\r\nbeen created. You should look here first if the console does not contain\r\na personality for your fixture. The address is\r\nhttp://personalities.avolites.com\r\n\r\n[![Avolites Personalities Website](/docs/images/Avolites-Personalities-Website.png)](https://personalities.avolites.com/)\r\n\r\nAll available fixture personalities are listed down the left side of the\r\nscreen.

Alternatively you can get this\r\nfile by clicking on the **Download** link at the top of the screen, then\r\nclicking on **Titan Fixture Library**.\r\n\r\n> Updating will overwrite any custom personalities you have stored in the library.

Search for the personality on the\r\nwebsite then click on the **Report Bug** icon on the right of the screen.\r\nIf you click on the [Bug Reports](https://personalities.avolites.com/Bug%20Queue.asp) tab at the top of the window, a list\r\nis shown of currently outstanding problems, so you can check if someone\r\nelse has already reported the problem.\r\n\r\nIn an emergency\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe console contains a selection of \"Generic\" fixtures which you can use\r\nin an emergency if you need to operate a fixture with no personality.\r\nWhen patching, go through the manufacturer list until you find\r\n\\[Generic\\]. In this section (among other fixtures) are the following:\r\n\r\nMulti-DMX: Has up to 10 DMX channels, all channels are LTP. You can\r\nselect from 1-10 channels on the Mode screen.

In cases where other lighting equipment manufacturers use the words to mean something else, this is listed in the text.\r\n\r\nword \t\t| meaning\r\n------------|----\r\nADDRESS\t\t| The first DMX channel/slot of the set of channels occupied by an individual Fixture. This is set on the fixture somehow (by a menu or switches or remotely using RDM).\r\nALIGN\t\t| A means of copying Attribute characteristics from the first Fixture selected to other selected fixtures, resulting in those attributes of the fixtures being aligned to each other.\r\nART-NET\t\t| An ethernet based system allowing multiple Universes of DMX to be sent over a network.\r\nATTRIBUTE\t| One function of a Fixture, such as “Colour Wheel” or “Focus”.\r\nATTRIBUTE GROUPS\t| see IPCGBES.\r\nAUTOLOAD\t| A Playback which is automatically fired by a Cue in a Cue List. Enables a chase to be fired by a cue list.\r\nBACKUPS\t\t| Copies of a show stored to a storage device for safety.\r\nBPM\t\t\t| Beats Per Minute. 60 BPM is equivalent to one step per second.\r\nBLIND\t\t| When set to Blind mode, changes made on the console do not affect the DMX output. Useful for making programming changes during a show.\r\nBUSKING\t\t| Operating the console live (usually for live music) when you do not have a complete show programmed, but instead creating effects as you go along using palettes etc.\r\nCELL\t\t| Part of a Fixture which can be controlled separately within the larger fixture – for example an LED batten may have 12 cells each of which can be controlled separately, or all together. Also called Subfixture.\r\nCHANNEL\t\t| Button allowing syntax / numeric style entry and operation of the console using the User Number of fixtures/dimmers.\r\nCHASE\t\t| A sequence of one or more pre recorded steps which automatically run one after the other.\r\nCOLOUR MIX / CMY\t| A system of three filters (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) that can each crossfade from white to a colour, or one colour to another. It is a feature of most Fixtures, which enables any colour to be created.\r\nCONNECTED CHASE\t| A Chase which is linked to the Wheels by pressing the <Connect> button.\r\nCUE\t\t\t| A single stage look programmed onto a Playback button or fader, or as part of a Cue List. Also known as MEMORY, STATE, SCENE, LOOK.\r\nCUE LIST\t| A sequence of cues programmed onto a Playback button or fader. Each cue can have its own delay and fade times and can also start other cues or playbacks. Also known as a CUE STACK or STACK.\r\nCUE MODE\t| A playback format programmed into a Cue which determines how the cue fades in and out. There are Cue Modes 0 - 3.\r\nCURVE\t\t| A curve sets how fades and other changes on the console progress over time. A variety of different curves may be selected.\r\nDEVICE\t\t| See FIXTURE.\r\nDIMMER\t\t| Device used to control the intensity of an individual light.\r\nDMX\tDMX512(1990) | a specification for communication between control desks and Fixtures, Originally for Dimmers it has been adopted as a control protocol for most Intelligent Fixtures. It can carry 512 different slots or channels of data per Universe, and Titan can output up to 64 universes (using additional network processors).\r\nEXCHANGE\t| A way to swap a Fixture in a show to a different type of fixture while retaining most or all of the programming.\r\nFADE\t\t| A continuous transition from one level to another.\r\nFAN\t\t\t| A way of automatically spreading out Attributes around a central point to speed up programming.\r\nFIXTURE\t\t| Any lighting instrument that is patched using a Personality. Generally refers to a moving light or colour changing light, not an individual Dimmer channel. Also called Intelligent Fixture, Device, Instrument, Moving Light.\r\nFIXTURE LAYOUT\t| A way of telling the console where Fixtures are physically located in 2D space, for use with Shapes or the Pixel Mapper.\r\nFLASH\t\t| Pushbutton which adds a playback into the existing output of the console. Historically called the ADD button. See also SWOP.\r\nFLIP\t\t| A function for use with Moving Head Fixtures. They have two possible Pan and Tilt settings for each position on stage by reversing the yoke, and FLIP will alternate between them.\r\nFOCUS\t\t| The library of stored positions, colours etc which are called Focuses on some consoles, are called Palettes on Titan. See PALETTE. This term may also be used in connection with moving fixtures to focus (set the sharpness) of a gobo projection.\r\nFX\t\t\t| Refers to effects created with the Shape Generator.\r\nGENERIC\t\t| Refers to a lighting instrument which only has a dimmer/intensity control. See also FIXTURE.\r\nGROUP\t\t| A Group is a pre-programmed collection of Fixtures that can be selected with a single button press. Playback groups can also be created where only one playback in the group can be active at any time.\r\nHALO\t\t| A special colour shown around the rim of a touch button, used to quickly identify different types of button.\r\nHANDLE\t\t| A control on the console where you can store things – may just be a programmable button, or may have a fader with one or more associated buttons.\r\nHTP\t\t\t| Highest Takes Precedence, a mechanism for determining the output level of an attribute (nearly always Intensity) being controlled by more than one Playback. The playback outputting the highest value at any given time will determine the level of the attribute. Also see LTP.\r\nHUD\t\t\t| Heads-up-display, an information window shown on the screen.\r\nINCLUDE\t\t| A means of transferring the contents of a Cue or Chase step back into the Programmer for further editing or programming.\r\nIPCGBESFX\t| The Attribute groups, used by the console to conveniently group together similar attributes – stands for Intensity, Position, Colour, Gobo, Beam, Effect, Special, FX (shapes). For example the P(osition) group includes Pan and Tilt attributes.\r\nKEY FRAME SHAPE\t| A self-programmed Shape where you program a set of steps which can then be spread in different ways over a set of fixtures.\r\nKEY PROFILE\t| User setting which can be used to change the function of each type of button on the console.\r\nLED\t\t\t| Light Emitting Diode, the source of light in many fixtures. May also refers to the small lights within the buttons on the console.\r\nLEGEND\t\t| The text or image used to name a handle so you know what you stored in it.\r\nLINK\t\t| Connection between cues in a Cue List or Chase enabling them to run on from one to another automatically.\r\nLOCATE\t\t| Button which places selected fixtures into a default “ready” state – usually a central position with full intensity, no colour, no gobo, ready for programming.\r\nLOCK\t\t| Handles can be Locked so that when you change to a different page, those handles do not change. The lock can be Transparent meaning that it is only locked if the new page doesn’t have any programming on that handle. May also refer to the system for locking the console while left unattended.\r\nLTP\t\t\t| Latest Takes Precedence, a mechanism for passing control of an attribute from one Playback to another on the basis that the latest playback changes take over control. Usually used for all attribute types except Intensity. Also see HTP.\r\nMACRO\t\t| Has two meanings in Titan. May refer to a stored sequence of button presses which allow you to recreate a complex sequence of operations from a single button. Or may refer to functions programmed into a Fixture by the manufacturer for example to lamp On/Off a fixture or reset the motors – using  DMX command sequences defined within the Personality.\r\nMASTER\t\t| Fader or knob giving overall control of a number of different playbacks or attributes. Different types of Masters can be configured on the console.\r\nMEMORY\t\t| The name for a Cue or playback on other consoles.\r\nMIDI\t\t| A control system used for sending commands between equipment. Stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and originally for sending musical notes between keyboards/synths, it is now used for controlling  and linking many types of equipment.\r\nMENU\t\t| List of available functions on the Softkeys.\r\nMENU LATCH\t| Holds the current menu active – normally a menu would close when the action is completed.\r\nML MENU\t\t| Provides additional functions for control of moving lights such as lamp on/off and other control functions.\r\nMOVE IN DARK (MID)\t| Function of Cue List to pre-position a fixture while it is turned off so that it is correctly positioned for the next cue. Called “Mark” on other consoles. \r\nON and OFF\t| Any Attribute stored in a Playback can be On or Off. An attribute which is ON is changed by the playback when it is fired. An attribute which is OFF is stored in the playback for future re-use but has no effect when the playback is fired.\r\nOVERLAP\t\t| Sets how the console allocates new values to a group of Fixtures. 100% means that all fixtures are updated simultaneously. 0% means that the fixtures will be updated one after the other.\r\nPAGE\t\t| To provide more Handles for programming, you can change to a different Page. You can Lock handles so that they do not change when you change the page.\r\nPALETTE\t\t| A term used to describe a referenced pre-defined state for an Attribute that can be recalled whenever required during programming. Each Fixture may be set to a different value in the Palette, the entries can be named, and recalled with a single button press. Called Focus by some other console manufacturers.\r\nPARK\t\t| A Parked fixture is one which is patched to a handle but has no DMX Address set. This happens to a fixture when its DMX address is taken by another fixture during a later patching session; the fixture retains programming information and the Repatch function can be used to give it a new DMX address. Not the same as the “Park channel” function used to set a channel to a fixed value as found on other consoles.\r\nPATCH\t\t| Set up of a show on the console, telling the console what fixtures are being used, what mode they are in, and what DMX address they are set to.\r\nPERSONALITY | A description of what Attributes a particular Fixture has and how the console will patch and use these. It also determines which Wheel will control which attribute. \r\nPIXEL MAPPER\t| Allows you to tell the console where fixtures are located in 2D space, and then to display patterns or media across those fixtures.\r\nPLAYBACK\t| A programmed Cue, Chase or Cue List, stored on a Handle (button, touch button or fader).\r\nPRELOAD\t\t| A playback button which sets the LTP channels in a cue but not the HTP channels. Used to pre-position fixtures before firing a cue. Also a cue list function which allows one cue to preload the LTP channels in another cue.\r\nPRESET FOCUS\t| The old name for Palettes on previous Avolites consoles and other consoles. See PALETTE.\r\nPROGRAMMER\t| The part of the console which contains Attribute information which has been changed by the user, prior to recording.\r\nQUICK PALETTE\t| If you press a palette button with no fixtures selected, the console will apply the palette to all fixtures it has programming for. This is called a Quick Palette.\r\nRANGE\t\t| If an Attribute on a fixture is split into certain zones for different effects, for example if the fixture can snap to 8 gobos selected by DMX values 1-32, 33-64, 65-96 etc then the attribute is said to have Ranges.\r\nRDM\t\t\t| Remote Device Management, a way of configuring fixtures remotely from the console. Not all fixtures support this.\r\nRELEASE\t\t| How a Playback leaves the LTP channels it was controlling when it is killed. Normally the LTP channels just remain in their last state, but you can use the Release settings to get them to revert to a previous state.\r\nRGB / RGBW\t| A system of colour mixing using LED emitters of different colours. Often more emitter colours are provided in the fixture to allow better colour rendering or mixing of pale tints. Possible colours include Red, Green, Blue, White, Amber, Lime, Cyan, UV - so you may see RGBAL fixtures or RGBAWUV.\r\nsACN\t\t| An ethernet-based system allowing multiple universes of DMX to be sent over a network.\r\nSELECT BUTTON\t| Blue button used to select a Handle when programming.\r\nSELECTED\t| A Fixture that is under manual control.\r\nSEQUENCE\t| Another name for a Chase on other consoles.\r\nSHAPE \t\t| A preprogrammed effect available which is applied to an Attribute. It can then be customised and stored in a cue.\r\nSHARED PALETTE\t| A Palette in which information is only stored for one Fixture, but is available to all fixtures of that type.\r\nSOFTKEY\t\t| Menu buttons marked A-J down the side of the screen, which have different functions as shown on the adjacent part of the screen depending on the currently active menu.\r\nSPREAD\t\t| How a shape or effect is output across a group of fixtures – if zero, all fixtures operate in synchronisation. Also called Phase.\r\nSTACK\t\t| Another name for a Cue List.\r\nSUBFIXTURE\t| See Cell.\r\nSWOP\t\t| Type of flash button which turns on the output being flashed and turns off all other output while the button is pressed. Sometimes called “Solo”. Also used for selecting fixtures or playbacks when programming. See also FLASH.\r\nTIMECODE\t| An electronic timer signal which allows cue list playback to be synchronised to a soundtrack or other events.\r\nTIMES\t\t| Many elements of programming can be timed to create effects, these together are referred to as Times.\r\nTNP\t\t\t| Titan Network Processor, a rackmount unit to handle the processing of additional DMX Universes or to operate automatic shows.\r\nTRACKING\t| Describes the operation of Cue Lists where attribute states follow through from previous cues unless changed by the user.\r\nTRIGGER POINT\t| The level set in the User Settings which determines at which point a Playback fader triggers the LTP channels programmed onto it.\r\nUNFOLD\t\t| A function that allows Chase steps to be laid out onto the playback faders for easy editing.\r\nUNIVERSE\t| A full set of 512 DMX control channels/slots. Titan consoles can create up to 64 universes, 16 on the console and the rest remotely using network processing.\r\nUPS\t\t\t| Uninterruptible Power Supply, fitted internally in some consoles, to keep the console running in case of power failure.\r\nUSER NUMBER\t| Each fixture / dimmer has a User Number which allows you to select them using the numeric keypad and <Through> button, as commonly used on other types of console.\r\nUSER SETTINGS\t| User definable desk settings. To change them, hold down the Avo button and select [User Settings].\r\nVIRTUAL DIMMER\t| Used with LED colour mixing fixtures, these add an intensity function to the fixture which masters the RGB controls on the fixture when it does not actually have an intensity control channel.\r\nVISUALISER\t| Software providing a lifelike 3D view of the stage and lighting, allowing virtual programming.\r\nWING\t\t| An additional panel of faders or buttons which can be connected to the console to expand the number of Handles available.\r\nWIPEALL\t\t| A process which clears the current show, providing a clean start. Does not affect previously saved shows.\r\nWHEEL\t\t| Wheels are used on the console to set fixture Attributes and to control chases and cue lists.\r\nYOKE\t\t| The U-shaped suspension mechanism for a moving head fixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "---\r\nid: a-quick-guide-to-ip-addressing\r\ntitle: A quick guide to IP addressing\r\nsidebar_label: A quick guide to IP addressing\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis section attempts to explain the basics of IP addressing, and what\r\nyou will need to know when setting up a lighting control network.\r\n\r\nIP addresses will normally come in the format `w.x.y.z` where `w`, `x`, `y`\r\nand `z` are numbers between 0 and 255, for example `192.168.0.1`. Every\r\nobject (or node or device) on a network should have a unique IP address.\r\nThis is the same concept as DMX as each fixture requires a unique DMX\r\naddress, for IP addresses the same is required.\r\n\r\nSetting your IP address\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe console has a setup function to quickly set its IP address as\r\ndescribed in the [previous section](controlling-fixtures-over-a-network.md#setting-the-consoles-ip-address).\r\n\r\nThere is a strong possibility that if you set the IP address on one\r\nnetwork device you will have to set it on all of them, therefore if you\r\nmanually set your IP address on the console you will have to do it on\r\nany TitanNet devices you are using and any Art-Net fixtures. Beware that\r\nsome Art-Net fixtures have a fixed IP address in the range `2.x.x.x`, in\r\nwhich case you have to set the console to that range.\r\n\r\nSubnet Masks\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThese are best kept simple. All devices or nodes on a network who wish\r\nto communicate with each other must have the same subnet mask. The mask\r\ndetermines which parts of the IP address are unique in that network to\r\neach node. If the part of the subnet mask is a 0 then the corresponding\r\ndigit in an IP address must be unique for each fixture. If the part in a\r\nsubnet mask is 255 then this part of the IP address needs to be the same\r\nfor each node.\r\n\r\nChoosing an IP address and Subnet Mask\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is the hardest part of setting up a network as your IP address\r\ntotally depends on what you are using on the network and what IP\r\naddresses you can and cannot change. Below are a number of example\r\nscenarios for standard lighting networks using a Titan console and what\r\nIP addresses should be set. *These aren't guaranteed to work but try them\r\nif the scenario matches your network.*\r\n\r\n",

This is a special address which will not function correctly.\r\n\r\nAutomatically assigning IP addresses (DHCP)\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere is another way of assigning IP addresses via an automatic system\r\ncalled DHCP, where one of the computers on the network will\r\nautomatically give other devices an IP address when it connects.\r\n\r\nGenerally we would not advise using DHCP on a lighting network as many\r\nnodes do not support it. If you must operate on a network with DHCP,\r\nmost DHCP servers will have a reserved range of \"static\" addresses\r\nwhich can be manually set. You can usually find these out from the\r\nDHCP server configuration.\r\n\r\nPrivate IP address ranges\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nIf your network is connected to the internet it is important to use a\r\nprivate IP address range. These are special IP addresses that will not\r\nbe routed onto the internet. They are:\r\n\r\nStart Address  | Final Address    | Subnet Mask\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\n10.0.0.0 | 10.255.255.255 | 255.0.0.0\r\n172.16.0.0 | 172.31.255.255 | 255.255.0.0\r\n192.168.0.0 | 192.168.255.255 | 255.255.255.0\r\n\r\n> For Art-Net, the 10.x.x.x range must be us",

    "content": "---\r\nid: connecting-the-arena-to-a-network \r\ntitle: Connecting the Arena to a network\r\nsidebar_label: Connecting the Arena to a network\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe Arena console is different to the other Titan consoles because it\r\nhas a built-in network switch and an optical network connection\r\n(optionally 2 optical connections). **This section applies only to the\r\nArena console.**\r\n\r\nOptical Connections\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe optical network connector is a Neutrik opticalCon Duo which uses\r\nmultimode fibre. A single connector is fitted as standard, but a second\r\ncan be fitted on request. The stage end of the connection normally plugs\r\ninto the Avolites TitanNet Switch (TNS) rack unit which provides\r\nstandard wired ethernet connections. If you want to connect to a\r\ndifferent optical switch you should contact Avolites for advice.\r\n\r\nWired Ethernet Outputs\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe Arena console has an in-built 1Gb TitanNet switch (TNS) that is\r\ndirectly connected to the console Main board on network connection 1.\r\nThe network switch has 4 ports available on the back of the console.\r\n\r\nThe mainboard Network Connection 2 is available on the EtherCon\r\nconnector at the back of the console and marked as \"secondary Ethernet\"\r\non the back. We recommend that this should only be used if you need to\r\nconnect to two different networks, for example the show network and an\r\noffice network for documentation.\r\n\r\nThe network switch and the controller for the switch both use an IP\r\naddress. When the controller IP address is set, the network switch will\r\nuse the next one (for example controller `10.19.0.50`, network switch\r\nbecomes `10.19.0.51`)\r\n\r\nChanging the IP address of the Titan Network Switch (TNS)\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe controller and network switch IP address do not need to be changed\r\nunless they overlap other devices on the network. The factory default is\r\n`10.19.aa.bb` where `aa.bb` is the serial number of the console *(e.g. `10.19.01.124` is\r\nserial number **379** or **255+124**)*.\r\n\r\nTo change the IP address of the TNS in the console:\r\n\r\n1. Open **USB Expert Console** from the **Tools** menu\r\n\r\n2. Select the TNS panel\r\n![USB Expert Tools - TNS Panel](/docs/images/USB-Expert-Tools-TNS-Panel.png)\r\n\r\n3. In the **IP Address Dialog**, set the new IP address.\r\n![USB Expert Tools - TNS Panel - IP Address Dialog](/docs/images/USB-Expert-Tools-TNS-Panel-IP-Address-Dialog.png)\r\n\r\nPower and UPS behaviour \r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe TitanNet switch in the console runs from the same UPS as the console\r\nitself, so if power fails the switch will continue working.\r\n\r\nWhen you power down the Arena, the UPS will continue to power the\r\ninternal switch for about 5 minutes. This is to allow you to restart the\r\nconsole without interrupting the network (for example if you have\r\nconnected a backup console via the Arena switch).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is called its \"IP address\".\r\n\r\nSetting the console's IP address\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you use the console's automatic IP setting function.\r\nHowever, if you need to you can also set the IP address using Windows\r\nControl Panel as shown on page 345.\r\n\r\n1. Switch to System mode and press \\[Network Settings\\]\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Local Area Connection\\].\r\n\r\n3. Press \\[Subnet Mask\\] and ensure it is set to `255.255.255.0`\r\n\r\n4.

The T1 dongle is limited to one DMX line, T2 to two DMX lines The\r\nlines may be routed to physical DMX sockets and/or to [network nodes](../networking/controlling-fixtures-over-a-network.md).\r\n\r\nA simple Art-Net system\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThere are various different systems for sending lighting control\r\ninformation over a network. One of the most widely supported is Art-Net.\r\n\r\nArt-Net is not specific to one range of products, and is recognised and\r\nimplemented by a growing number of manufacturers. Many products (such as\r\nDimmers and Moving lights) can accept the Art-Net signal directly, so\r\nthere is no need to convert the signal to DMX. Most people will,\r\nhowever, need to output DMX to their equipment and this can be done\r\nusing an Art-Net to DMX converter.\r\n\r\nIn the following diagram, an Art-Net compliant Console (such as a Titan\r\nconsole) is connected via a network hub to an Art-Net compatible dimmer\r\nand 2 DMX conversion boxes.\r\n\r\n![Art Net Explanation\r\ngeneral](/docs/images/Art-Net-Explanation-general.jpeg)\r\n\r\nOnce the system is connected together, the different outputs (or Nodes)\r\ncan be configured.\r\n\r\n-   The dimmer is given the start address of 200\r\n\r\n-   The 1st DMX box is set to universe 1 and universe 2\r\n\r\n-   The 2nd DMX box is also set to universe 1 and universe 2\r\n\r\nThe console is then used to set the DMX lines to the Art-Net nodes.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember:\r\n\r\n-   Each Art-Net to DMX box (or compatible Dimmer, or compatible moving\r\n    light) is a device,\r\n\r\n-   Each device may have one or more nodes(i.e. the Art-Net to DMX box\r\n    has 2 nodes, these are the 2 DMX outputs; the dimmer itself is a\r\n    node),\r\n\r\n-   Each node can be set to a Universe (1-256). This universe is\r\n    equivalent to a 512 channel DMX line\r\n\r\nYou can then specify which console line is assigned to each node. A\r\nconsole line can be assigned to multiple nodes (this will duplicate the\r\nDMX universe), but each node should have only one console line assigned\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nHere, the console assigns the following:\r\n\r\n-   Line A to Box 1 universe 1 and box 2 universe 1\r\n\r\n-   Line B to Box 1 universe 2\r\n\r\n-   Line C to Box 2 universe 2 and the dimmer rack\r\n\r\n![Art Net Explanation Nodes to\r\nDMX](/docs/images/Art-Net-Explanation-Nodes-to-DMX.jpeg)\r\n\r\nSetting up an Art-Net system\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nFor this example, it is assumed that you will connect the console to an\r\nArt-Net DMX output box (such as an Artistic License Net-Lynx) via a\r\nnetwork hub.\r\n\r\n![Art Net Explanation Simple\r\nSystem](/docs/images/Art-Net-Explanation-Simple-System.jpeg)Using standard RJ45 ethernet cables,\r\nattach the devices together.\r\n\r\n-   If you are using a hub/switch as shown above, use straight-through\r\n    patch cables. If you are directly connecting the console to another\r\n    Ethernet device you need to use crossover cables.\r\n\r\nSet the Net-Lynx box as follows:\r\n\r\n-   Subnet Mask = 0\r\n\r\n-   DMX A Universe = 1\r\n\r\n-   DMX B Universe = 2\r\n\r\nA lot of Art-Net devices, including the Net-Lynx box, are set to IP\r\naddress 2.x.x.x as default, and can be set to 10.x.x.x using an option\r\njumper, so you should check what the setting of your device is.\r\n\r\nIf your Art-Net devices need to be set to a non-standard IP address,\r\nthen in steps 1 and 2 you need to use Windows Control Panel to set the\r\nconsole to that address range instead of 2.x.x.x\r\n\r\nWith everything connected, start the console.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure the console has an IP in the 2.x.x.x range as described at\r\nthe start of the chapter.\r\n\r\n2. Switch the console to System and select \\[DMX Settings\\].\r\n\r\n3. The DMX Settings window should open.\r\n\r\n4. Select the Art-Net module from the node list in the left hand side\r\nof the window.\r\n\r\n5. Press the small 'i' button to show the node properties. Ensure that\r\nthe correct Network adapter is set (this may not be the Default Adapter)\r\n\r\n6. If you wish to turn off the Art-Net output, you can unselect the\r\n\\\"Enable DMX output\\\" option. This will stop the Console from outputting\r\nArt-Net on any Lines.\r\n\r\n7. Art-Net normally only sends Data when it is changed, rather than a\r\ncontinuous stream. There are times when it is preferable to send Art-Net\r\nall the time. to do this, select the \\\"Continuous Art-Net Data Stream\\\"\r\noption.\r\n\r\n8. The \\\"Always broadcast Art-Net\\\" option enables you to send Art-Net\r\nto the entire network, rather than a specific IP address.\r\n\r\n9. Press the blue → arrow on the Art-Net node to connect it to a DMX\r\noutput line.\r\n\r\n10. Select a console DMX line from the right hand side of the window.\r\n\r\n11. The DMX line will now be outputting over the selected Art-Net node.\r\n\r\n12. Click 'i' on the node you have added to make sure the properties\r\nare correct. (Problems can be caused if you attach multiple DMX lines to\r\na single node.)\r\n\r\n13. Make sure that the Universe is set to 1 for Line 1, and 2 for Line 2.  \r\nArt-Net uses a subnet mask with its universe. For Titan purposes:  \r\nTitan universes 1 - 16 are subnet mask = 0, Art-Net universes = 1 -- 16\r\n\r\n14. You can close the DMX settings window.\r\n\r\nThe console should now be working correctly.\r\n\r\nTo remove a node from a DMX line, select the node and click the blue X\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\n\\\"Unpolled\\\" and \\\"unknown\\\" devices may appear as Art-Net nodes.\r\n\r\n-   An unpolled device is a \\'rolling extra\\' which allows more than 4\r\n    connections to be made to a particular Art-Net device. The Art-Net\r\n    specification only allows each device to advertise a max of 4\r\n    universes so if you need to add more the console has to invent the\r\n    5th, 6th, etc universes.\r\n\r\n-   An unknown device is one which doesn't format an Art-Net poll reply\r\n    properly so the console doesn\\'t known if it is an input or output\r\n    device.\r\n\r\nAdditional Art-Net Resources\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nTo find out more information about Art-Net please refer to the Art-Net\r\nStandard published by [Artistic\r\nLicence](http://www.artisticlicence.com).\r\n",

This is often used with media servers to allow the\r\nconsole to get media thumbnail images and layer information from the\r\nserver. The thumbnail images can then be used on the console to select\r\nmedia clips.\r\n\r\nThis section does not apply to Ai media servers which use the Synergy\r\nsystem to communicate with Titan consoles.\r\n\r\nExample CITP setup\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThis example shows how to set up a Hippotizer with Titan.\r\n\r\n1. Connect the console and Hippotizer to the network. (You can connect\r\nthe Hippotizer directly to the console, if no other devices are being\r\nconnected, using a crossover patch cable).\r\n\r\n2. Set up the IP addresses and subnet masks of the console and Hippo so\r\nthat they are on the same address range, for example `192.168.0.1` and\r\n`192.168.0.2`.\r\n\r\n3. If you are using Titan Mobile or Titan Simulator ensure the firewall\r\non your PC is disabled. Also ensure the Hippo machine is not running a\r\nfirewall.\r\n\r\n4. Run the Hippo system. Make sure the CITP component is running.\r\n\r\n5. Switch the console to System mode and select \\[DMX Settings\\].\r\n\r\n6. On the left hand side under Art-Net you should see the Hippo with\r\nits IP address. Click on it and then on the right hand side click on the\r\nDMX line you want to use it with.\r\n\r\n7. On the Hippo node on the left hand side, click the 'i' button and\r\nset the Universe number to match the universe setting on the Hippo.\r\n\r\n8. \\<Exit\\> System mode back to the default menu.\r\n\r\n9. Restart the console software using the option on the Tools menu (for\r\nTitan Mobile, Titan Go or Simulator just close and restart the Titan\r\nsoftware).\r\n\r\n10. Go into Patch mode and select \\[Active Fixtures\\]. You should see\r\nthe Hippo with its IP address as a softkey option.\r\n\r\n11. Select the Hippo, then set the DMX line to match the line you set\r\nin Step 6.\r\n\r\n12. Press an empty fixture handle to patch. The console will\r\nautomatically patch the required layers and master layer as a series of\r\nfixture buttons.\r\n\r\n13. Now if you select a fixture and open the Attribute Editor window\r\nyou should see the media thumbnails.\r\n\r\nThe next time you start the system, ensure the Hippo is powered up\r\nbefore you start the console.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to re-patch to a different DMX address you will need to\r\nre-start the Hippotizer software. You will also need to reset the\r\nArt-Net nodes if you are moving across DMX lines.\r\n",

You can set this from the DMX module properties in the DMX\r\nSettings window, each port is listed with a switch to enable or disable\r\nit.\r\n\r\nYou can also connect to [networked processing nodes](titan-net.md), which allow you to\r\ncontrol up to 64 universes of DMX.\r\n\r\nThe console may also be networked with other Titan consoles for\r\nmulti-user control, and for backup.\r\n\r\n\r\n> At the end of the chapter is a section which aims to cover [the basics of\r\nIP addressing](networking/a-quick-guide-to-ip-addressing.md), which is essential for various features on the console\r\nsuch as Art-Net.\r\n\r\n---\r\n  \r\n> Lighting networks need to transfer of large amounts of data. For best reliability you should use network wiring which is dedicated to the lighting system and physically isolated from other networks, and uses simple hubs rather than intelligent switches.\r\n  \r\nConnecting to an existing network with other network traffic is possible but can lead to problems both with the lighting equipment and with other IT equipment on the network. Intelligent Ethernet switches may drop or block lighting data.

You can copy or move multiple palettes in one\r\noperation. You cannot link palette buttons.\r\n\r\nMove is useful for tidying up the console.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Copy\\>\r\n\r\n2. Select \\[Copy\\] or \\[Move\\]. Pressing the \\<Copy\\> button again will\r\nalso toggle these options. Some consoles have a \\<Move\\> button.\r\n\r\n3. Press the **Select** button of the palette you want to copy/move. You\r\ncan select multiple palettes - use the \\<Thro\\> and \\<And\\> buttons to\r\nadd more to the selection - hold down \\<And\\> to keep adding them.\r\n\r\n4. Press the empty button where you want it to go\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n-   The \\<Menu Latch\\> button latches the **Copy/Move/Link menu**, so you\r\n    can keep copying, moving or linking things without having to keep\r\n    pressing \\<Copy\\>. Press \\<Menu Latch\\> again to unlatch.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Retain Layout\\] or \\[Bunch Up\\] is used when copying a group of\r\n    palettes with empty handles in the group - you can either keep the\r\n    empty handles, or bunch up the used handles together.\r\n\r\n-   When in Copy mode, option \\[Copy Legends\\] can be changed to \\[Don't\r\n    copy legends\\] so that the copied palettes are given default\r\n    legends.\r\n\r\n-   When in Move mode, \\[Swap Items if Required\\] will attempt to\r\n    reposition any existing handles which are in the way of the move.\r\n    This is useful when rearranging buttons on a page which is nearly\r\n    full.\r\n\r\nDeleting Palettes\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nYou can delete a palette entry by pressing \\<Delete\\>, then pressing the\r\npalette's button to be deleted.

The\r\nconsole helps you with this by providing separate windows for **Colour**\r\npalettes, **Position** palettes, and **Gobo/Beam** palettes.\r\n\r\nWhen you store a palette, it will only contain what's in the programmer\r\n(the attributes you have changed since you last pressed \\<Clear\\>). For\r\nexample to create a colour palette you would just set the colour, and\r\nnot change any other attribute. You can also make palettes which contain\r\neffects such as shapes and pixel mapping. If fade or delay times are\r\nprogrammed for fixtures or attributes, these will also be stored in the\r\npalette, and you can also create [palettes which contain only time\r\ninformation](#creating-a-time-palette).\r\n\r\nIf the programmer contains more than one attribute, you can set a mask\r\nto restrict which fixture attributes will be stored in the palette.\r\n\r\nPalette information may be **Global**, **Shared** or **Normal**:\r\n\r\n- **Global** palettes work on any type of fixture\r\n- **Shared** palettes apply the same value to all fixtures of the same type -\r\n*for example when setting\r\ncolours, the \"Red\" palette would set the same colour values for \"Red\" to\r\nall MAC 2000 fixtures*\r\n- **Normal** palettes are used when each fixture\r\nrequires its own value - *for example when programming positions, each\r\nfixture will have a different setting*\r\n\r\nIt is possible, by merging information into palettes, to create a\r\npalette which contains global, shared and normal attributes.\r\n\r\nAvailable attributes for Global palettes are Dimmer, Pan, Tilt and\r\nColour. When creating a global palette for a colour mixing fixture, both\r\nCMY and RGB attributes are calculated and a special \"dynamic\" value is\r\nadded to colour wheel channels, the console will attempt to match the\r\nclosest fixed colour wheel colour to the selected mix colour.\r\n\r\nThere is a [User Setting \"Minimum Palette Mode\"](../system-settings/user-settings.md#minimum-palette-mode)\r\nwhich can force the console to record palettes in **Shared** or **Normal** mode.\r\n\r\nStoring a Palette\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/Hs-xzpD5x8k?t=20 \"Recording Palettes\")\r\n\r\nThis is how you save a palette value to one of the palette windows:. If\r\nthe palette windows are not shown then press the **Groups and Palettes**\r\nworkspace button.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Clear\\> to clear the programmer\r\n\r\n2. Select the fixtures for which you want to store palette values\r\n\r\n3. Using the attribute buttons and wheels, set the attributes you want\r\nin the palette entry\\\r\n*You can store any or all attributes of a fixture in each palette entry*\r\n\r\n4. Press \\<Record\\> then \\<Palette\\> (or \\<Palette\\> then \\[Record\r\nPalette\\])\\\r\n*Using [Quick Record](#quick-record) you can skip this\r\nstep and the palette mask is set automatically to match the window.*\r\n\r\n5. If you wish, set the palette mask - this sets which attributes will\r\nbe recorded in the palette. Select attributes using the Attribute Bank\r\nbuttons - anything lit up will be saved. \\[Set Mask\\] and \\[Record by\\]\r\nsoftkeys also control the Mask (see below).\r\n\r\n6. Touch a button in one of the palette windows to store the palette\r\n(if you touch a used button you will be given further options). Or enter\r\na palette number and press \\[Store\\]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n-   If you want to record to a physical button, press \\<Record\\> then\r\n    \\<Palette\\>. All buttons where you can store the palette will then\r\n    flash, press one to store.\r\n\r\n![Recording a Palette menu](/docs/images/Recording-a-Palette-menu.png)\r\n\r\n-   The console will automatically set the palette as Global, Shared or\r\n    Normal (by checking if the values to be stored are the same across\r\n    all fixtures of the same type). You can override the setting by\r\n    pressing \\[softkey C\\]. See below for more details of how this automatic\r\n    choice works.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Set Mask\\] allows you to specify which attribute groups will be\r\n    included in the palette. You can also use the grey Attribute Bank\r\n    buttons on the right hand edge of the console to set the mask.\\\r\n    An attribute group is included when the softkey is inverted (like\r\n    the Colour group in the picture) and when the LED is lit on the\r\n    Attribute Bank button. If you use **[Quick Record](#quick-record)**\r\n    the mask is automatically set by the workspace window you\r\n    save the palette in - Positions only includes P, Colours only C and\r\n    Beams includes IGBES. If you use the \\<Record\\> button then you need\r\n    to set the mask manually.\r\n\r\n-   Press the **Attribute Options** button to toggle each mask group between\r\n    Include and Exclude.\r\n\r\n![Setting a mask for recording a palette](/docs/images/Setting-a-mask-for-recording-a-palette.png)\r\n\r\n-   \\[Record By...\\] allows you to control how the mask is used when\r\n    saving the palette. The options are:\r\n    -   \\[Channel in programmer\\] records only channels which are in the\r\n    programmer (ones which you have changed)\r\n    -    \\[Group in programmer\\] records all channels in any attribute group\r\n    which has one or more channels in the programmer. *For example if\r\n    Cyan is in the programmer, all colour channel settings will be\r\n    recorded even if not in the programmer.*\r\n    -   \\[Group in mask\\] records everything included by the mask set on the\r\n    attribute buttons\r\n    -   \\[Mixed\\] records by attribute group for **Position** and **Colour** but by\r\n    channel for all other controls.\r\n\r\n-   The console will automatically create a legend for your palette\r\n    (unless the\r\n    [User Setting \\[Auto Legend\\]](../system-settings/user-settings.md#auto-legend)\r\n    is set to Off). For colour\r\n    palettes a coloured icon is used to show the selected colour. If the\r\n    palette contains fixtures set to different colours, a coloured bar\r\n    will be shown for each. For CITP (media server) palettes, the media\r\n    thumbnail will be used. For other attributes the last adjusted\r\n    function value will be used for the legend, except for pan and tilt\r\n    which will use a default legend.\\\r\n    ![Automatic Legends set for Colour Palettes](/docs/images/Automatic-Legends-set-for-Colour-Palettes.png)\r\n\r\n-   You can also manually set a legend for the palette while you are\r\n    saving it using \\[Provide a legend\\]. See\r\n    [Setting Legends for Palettes](#setting-legends-for-palettes).\r\n\r\n-   If you select a Palette button which is already used, the console\r\n    offers you options to \\[Cancel\\], \\[Replace\\], \\[Merge\\] or \\[Quick\r\n    Merge\\] the existing palette.\r\n    - \\[Replace\\] will erase the palette and save only the latest changes\r\n        you have made\r\n    - \\[Merge\\] will combine your changes with the palette\r\n    - \\[Quick Merge\\] will merge only the\r\n    attributes which are currently stored in the palette - the button\r\n    shows you which attributes.\r\n\r\n    This allows you to add settings for additional types of fixtures to\r\n    a shared palette or to update the existing fixture settings.\r\n    Pressing the palette button again will automatically merge using\r\n    Quick Merge.\r\n\r\n-   The console will select **Global** mode if the programmer contains the\r\n    same values for all selected fixtures and one or more of the\r\n    attributes is suitable for Global. If the values are the same but\r\n    none of the attributes are suitable for Global the console will\r\n    select Shared. If some attributes are suitable and some aren't, the\r\n    console will record the suitable ones as Global and the others as\r\n    Shared. If the values are different the console will select Normal.\r\n    You can prevent the console from using Global and/or Shared modes\r\n    using the **[Minimum Palette Mode](../system-settings/user-settings.md#minimum-palette-mode)**\r\n    option in the [Palettes tab](../system-settings/user-settings.md#palettes) of\r\n    [User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md).\r\n\r\nNested Palettes\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nPalettes can contain references from other palettes. For example an\r\nodd/even colour palette could be created using two other colour palettes\r\nas the masters. If you wanted to change the colours, changing the master\r\ncolour palettes would also change the odd/even colours.\r\n\r\nThe \\[Record/Don't Record Nested Palettes\\] option in the Record Palette\r\nmenu sets whether nested palettes are recorded *(default)* or whether the\r\nattribute values are recorded instead.\r\n\r\nWhen palettes are used in cues, you can disable the nested palettes\r\nusing the playback option \\[Fire/Don't Fire Nested Palettes\\]. If set to\r\nDon't Fire, the nested palettes are treated as the fixed values they\r\nheld at the time the cue was recorded and won't change if the nested\r\npalette is updated.\r\n\r\nQuick Record\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe palette windows allow you to quickly record a new palette. Just\r\ntouch the button where you want to record - the button will turn red\r\nwith a + sign. At this point you can enter a legend for the new palette\r\nor change mask settings. A second press on the button will save the\r\npalette.\r\n\r\n![Recoding a Workspace Layout](/docs/images/Recoding-a-Workspace-Layout.png)\r\n\r\nWhen using Quick Record, the palette mask is automatically set to\r\nmatch the window - the **Position** window only stores **P**, the **Colours**\r\nwindow only **C**, and the **Gobos and Beams** window stores **IGBES**. This\r\ndoes not happen if you use the \\<Record\\> button.\r\n\r\nQuick record also works for groups and workspaces.\r\n\r\n> If you want to load a show from a **Pearl Expert** onto another Titan console,\r\nuse the **Groups and Palettes workspace window** to access the fixtures/palettes\r\non the blue/grey preset buttons on the Pearl. See\r\n[Compatibility Windows for Pearl Expert Shows](../titan-basics/workspace-windows.md#compatibility-windows-for-pearl-expert-shows)\r\nfor more details.\r\n\r\nSetting Legends for Palettes\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can enter a legend for each palette to tell you what it is. Titan\r\nwill automatically create helpful legends when you create the palette.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\[Set Legend\\] at the top level menu\r\n\r\n2. Press the palette button for the palette you want to legend\r\n\r\n3. Type the legend on the keyboard\r\n\r\n4. Press \\<Enter\\> when you have finished\r\n\r\nOn touch buttons, the palette number is shown top left. The **IPCGBES**\r\nattribute groups contained in the palette are displayed below your\r\nlegend, so for example **Position** palettes will show a **P**, **colour**\r\npalettes a **C** and so on. In the top right corner is shown **G** for\r\n**Global**, **N** for **Normal** or **S** for **Shared** palette.\r\n\r\n![Shared and normal palettes stored on a touch screen](/docs/images/Shared-and-normal-palettes-stored-on-a-touch-screen.png)\r\n\r\nYou can create a picture legend for your palette which could for example\r\nrepresent the colour or gobo it will create. After pressing \\[Set\r\nLegend\\] and the palette button, press \\[Picture\\]. The picture editor\r\nwill open.\r\n\r\n![Setting legend of palette using draw picture editor](/docs/images/Setting-legend-of-palette-using-draw-picture-editor.png)\r\n\r\nThe tab buttons on the top left allow you to select Keyboard entry\r\n(legend reverts to text), Draw, Icon Library, or Load File. On the right\r\nyou can choose Pen or Eraser, set the pen/eraser size, set the colour\r\n(white in the above picture), **clear** the whole picture, and **Enter** the\r\nlegend. The **Min** button top left reduces the editor to a smaller size.\r\n\r\nIf you select Library you can choose a picture from a wide range of\r\npre-programmed pictures. The pictures are sorted into various folders\r\nwhich are listed on the left.\r\n\r\n![Setting legend of palette using Icon Library](/docs/images/Setting-legend-of-palette-using-Icon-Library.png)\r\n\r\nCreating an Effects Palette (Shape or Pixel Mapper)\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSpeed up your programming by creating some palettes which apply [shapes\r\nor pixel mapping effects](../effects.md). You can't save a keyframe shape to a palette.\r\n\r\nFor an effects palette to be useful, it needs to contain only effect\r\nsettings (for example, for a pan/tilt circle you want it to move the\r\nfixtures around their current set position, not to change the position\r\nas well). To achieve this you can either use the FX mask when saving the\r\npalette, or you can just remember not to set any other values when\r\nprogramming.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Clear\\>, select some fixtures and \\<Locate\\> them\\\r\n*If you need to move them so you can see what's happening, you can do that too*\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Shapes and Effects\\], \\[Shape Generator\\] and choose a shape\r\nto start\\\r\n*See [Shape Generator](../effects/shape-generator.md) for more information about shapes*\r\n\r\n3.

A context menu button allows you to switch to displaying **Times**.\r\n\r\nPress \\<View/Open\\>, then the button of the palette. The **Palette View\r\nwindow** will open.\r\n\r\n![Palette View window](/docs/images/Palette-View-window.png)\r\n\r\nYou can filter which attributes are shown using the **All/IPCGBES** buttons\r\nin the top corner, or which fixtures are shown using the fixture type\r\nbuttons below that.\r\n\r\nTo edit an attribute value, touch/click on it in the window. The\r\nsoftkeys will give you a list of available settings for this attribute\r\nor you can type in a numerical value.\r\n\r\nThere is also a \\[Delete\\] button which allows you to remove the value\r\nfrom the attribute. This is the same as using the\r\n[\\<Off\\> function](../cues/editing-cues.md#removing-attributes-from-cues-using-off).\r\n\r\n-   When the palette contains other palettes, the context menu option\r\n    \\[View/Hide Nested Palettes\\] sets whether or not the view shows the\r\n    actual attribute value or just the name of the nested palette.\r\n\r\n-   When the palette contains shapes, the context menu option \\[View\r\n    Shapes\\] will open the Shape View showing all the shapes with their\r\n    parameter. Clicking **View** will open the **Shape Fixture View** which lets\r\n    you edit the fixtures running the shape; the **Add Fixtures** menu\r\n    button will add selected fixtures into the shape.\r\n\r\n-   When the palette contains effects (Pixel Mapper) the context menu\r\n    option \\[View Effects\\] will open the **Effect View window** to let you\r\n    edit the effect.\r\n\r\nChanging the Content of Palettes\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo edit a palette entry, press \\<Edit\\> (\\<Update Palette\\> on Pearl\r\nExpert and Tiger Touch mk1), then select the palette to edit.

Next, make the changes you want, then press the \\[Update\r\nPalette x\\] softkey to save the changes.\r\n\r\nThe \\<Edit\\>/\\<Update Palette\\> button also allows you to change the\r\npalette name and number.\r\n\r\nYou can also load the palette into some fixtures, modify the attributes\r\nand record the new information back on top of the existing palette\r\nentry. The console will give you options on the softkeys to **Replace**,\r\n**Merge** or **Quick Merge** the palettes. If you select **Merge**, anything you\r\nhaven't changed will not be affected, values you have changed or added\r\nwill be amended. **Quick Merge** will only update the attributes stored in\r\nthe original palette and ignore others *(for example if you are merging\r\nwith a position palette, but have also modified the colour attributes,\r\nthe colour attributes would not be merged in)*.\r\n\r\nWhen double clicking a palette button to update, the default option is\r\n**Quick Merge**.\r\n\r\n-   You can set the console to \r\n    [\"Always Merge\"](../system-settings/user-settings.md#prompt-replace)\r\n    (so it doesn't ask you) using the \r\n    [User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md).\\\r\n    You can also press the palette button a second time to select the\r\n    **Merge** option.\r\n\r\n-   You can add additional fixtures to a palette without affecting\r\n    existing ones.\\\r\n    *For example, if you have colour palettes for Mac\r\n    600s, you can add colours for your Mac 500s without affecting any\r\n    previously recorded values in the palette.*\r\n\r\n-   You can remove attributes from palettes using the\r\n    [\\<Off\\> function](../cues/editing-cues.md#removing-attributes-from-cues-using-off)\r\n\r\n-   When editing a palette the state of the programmer will be\r\n    preserved; when the modified palette is saved, your original\r\n    programmer contents will be restored and the programmer will be left\r\n    in the same state as when you started editing the palette.\r\n\r\nUpdating Palettes Used in a Playback\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you need to quickly update a palette during a show, for example you\r\nfire a green cue and the Green palette used turns out to be not quite\r\nthe right colour, the \\<Update\\> function lets you automatically update the\r\npalette used in the cue.\r\n\r\n1.

If\r\n    you show parked fixtures they will appear greyed out in the position\r\n    they were originally patched.\r\n\r\nView Detailed Fixture Information\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn the Patch View window click on the View button for the fixture you\r\nwish to view, or press \\<View/Open\\> followed by a fixture handle. A\r\nFixture View window will open showing details for that fixture,\r\nincluding the personality and mode used to patch, and the individual DMX\r\nchannel addresses for each attribute. Attributes can be inverted or\r\nfrozen by clicking on the checkboxes at the right hand side.\r\n\r\n![Fixture View](/docs/images/Fixture-View.png)\r\n\r\nIf the fixture address is set using DIP switches, the console can show\r\nyou how to set the switches by clicking on the DIP Switches tab.\r\n\r\n![Dip Switches](/docs/images/Dip-Switches.png)\r\n\r\nThere is also a Personality tab (not shown in the pictures) which shows\r\nhistory information about the personality file for the fixture. This can\r\nbe useful for checking the version of the personality file.\r\n\r\nChanging DMX Addressing using Patch View\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can easily change the DMX address of one or more fixtures from Patch\r\nView. Select the DMX address cells you want to modify - draw a\r\nselection box over multiple cells to select more than one.\r\n\r\n![Change DMX Address](/docs/images/Change-DMX-Address.png)\r\n\r\nType the new address for the first fixture in the selection and press\r\n\\<Enter\\> (using the format Universe . Address - if you miss out the\r\nuniverse part it will stay unchanged).\r\n\r\nAll fixtures will be renumbered keeping the addressing offset between\r\nthe fixtures the same (in other words if each fixture takes 20 channels,\r\nthe addresses will be set with an offset of 20 channels between each\r\nfixture).\r\n\r\nThe \\[Swap Fixture Addresses\\] softkey lets you swap the addressing\r\nbetween two groups of fixtures. This operates in two modes, \\[One For\r\nOne\\] or \\[Retain Layout\\], which you can select by softkey after\r\npressing \\[Swap Fixture Addresses\\].\\\r\nSelect one group, then press \\[Swap Fixture Addresses\\] and select the\r\ntarget group. In One for One mode the target must be the same quantity\r\nof fixtures or the console will display an error. In Retain Layout mode\r\nthe console will attempt to add or remove fixtures to get the same\r\nquantity - if this conflicts with other fixtures it will give you the\r\noptions to \\[Park Conflicting\\] or \\[Cancel\\].\r\n\r\nChanging DMX address using Patch menu\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs well as using the Patch View screen, you can use the Patch menu to\r\nre-patch a fixture to a different DMX address or a different DMX output\r\nline. All programming is kept.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Patch\\> (if you're not already in Patch mode).\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Repatch Fixtures\\].\r\n\r\n3. Press the Select button of the fixture you want to change.\r\n\r\n4. To change DMX press \\[Address\\], type the new address and press\r\nenter. If this address is already in use, a warning icon will be shown.\r\n![Address softkey](/docs/images/Address-softkey.png)\r\n\r\n5. To change the DMX output line, press \\[DMX Line=x\\] and enter a new\r\noutput line number.\r\n\r\n6. Press \\<Enter\\> or \\[Repatch\\] to confirm the change.\r\n\r\n7. Repeat from step 3 if you want to change other fixtures.\r\n\r\n-   You can \"Park\" the fixture using \\[Park\\]. This removes the fixture\r\n    from the DMX output map, but all programming is retained. The\r\n    original DMX line and address is remembered and you can restore it\r\n    using the \\[Unpark\\] option.\r\n\r\n-   If the new DMX address already has another fixture or dimmer patched\r\n    on it, the console will warn you (unless this is disabled in [User\r\n    Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md)). You can either press\r\n    \\[Select another DMX address\\] to abort the change or \\[Park\r\n    Conflicting Fixtures\\]. All programming for the parked fixture is\r\n    preserved, but you need to repatch it to a free DMX address using\r\n    the above procedure before you can use it again. If you press\r\n    \\[Always Park Conflicting Fixtures\\] the console will park this and\r\n    any future conflicting fixtures without warning you (you can change\r\n    this option back in the User Settings).\r\n\r\n![Fixture Conflict](/docs/images/Fixture-Conflict.png)\r\n\r\nSetting Legends\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nYou can set a legend for each fixture or dimmer you've patched which is\r\ndisplayed in the touch button. This can be really useful to help you\r\nidentify the fixture.\r\n\r\n1. At the main menu press \\[Set Legend\\].\r\n\r\n2. Press the Select button for the fixture you want to legend.\r\n\r\n3. Type the legend on the keyboard.\r\n\r\n4. Press \\<Enter\\> when you have finished.\r\n\r\n-   You can also choose to have a picture legend using the softkey\r\n    options.\r\n\r\n-   You can set the same legend for multiple fixtures by selecting a\r\n    group of fixtures after pressing \\[Set Legend\\].\r\n\r\n-   You can change the User Number for the fixture using the \\[User\r\n    Number\\] softkey on the \\[Set Legend\\] menu. User Numbers are used\r\n    when selecting fixtures from the keypad theatre-style.\r\n\r\n-   You can automatically allocate User Numbers for multiple fixtures by\r\n    selecting a group of fixtures, then setting \\[User Number\\]. The\r\n    first fixture will have the User Number you entered, and the other\r\n    selected fixtures will be given a number increasing by 1 for each\r\n    fixture.\r\n\r\n-   You can set a legend for the current page of fixtures using the\r\n    \\[Set Legend\\] function from the main Program menu. The legend is\r\n    shown on the touch button for the page and on the HUD.\r\n\r\nFixture Button Halo\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nYou can configure fixture buttons to have a \"halo\" colour which helps\r\nyou to find them quickly. Halo colours can be set manually for each\r\nfixture (the default setting), or automatically by fixture type using\r\nthe same fixture colours used in the patch window..\r\n\r\nTo set a manual halo colour, click \\[Set Legend\\], click the fixture\r\nbutton (or select multiple buttons) then select the \\[Halo\\] option. A\r\ncolour picker will open to let you set the colour, or pressing \\[System\r\nColours\\] will give you colour options on the softkeys. A \\[Remove\r\nHalo\\] softkey lets you remove the colour.\r\n\r\n![Fixture Halo](/docs/images/Fixture-Halo.png)\r\n\r\nTo enable automatic halo colours, hold \\<Avo\\> and select \\[User\r\nSettings\\], then \\[Handles\\], then set Fixture Halos to \\[Auto\\].\r\nFixture buttons will then be coloured to match the automatic fixture\r\ncolours used in the Patch window.\r\n\r\nHalo colours are also shown in the Intensity View and Show Library\r\nworkspace. In list views such as DMX, Channel Grid, Cue View and Palette\r\nview the halo colours are shown as a bar to the left of the list - this\r\nuses the user halo colour if one is set, otherwise the automatic colour\r\nis used. The User Setting does not affect this display.\r\n\r\n![Cue View](/docs/images/Cue-View.png)\r\n\r\nDMX View Window\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nWhen you're having problems getting fixtures to work it can be useful to\r\nsee the actual DMX output values coming from the console. Press\r\n\\<View/Open\\>, then \\[Open Workspace Window\\], then select \\[DMX\\].\r\n\r\n![DMX Workspace Window](/docs/images/DMX-Workspace-Window.png)\r\n\r\nThe buttons on the left let you select the different output lines from\r\nthe console. Scrolling the window to the right shows more information\r\nabout each DMX channel.\r\n\r\nFixture Exchange\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/a_ES6UYQRJ4?t=20 \"Advanced Patching\")\r\n\r\nThe Fixture Exchange function enables you to repatch fixtures in your\r\nshow using alternative fixtures, retaining important elements such as\r\ncue times, shapes and legends. This is very useful for touring shows and\r\nvenues with a high turnover of events.\r\n\r\nFixture Exchange works best if you use Palettes to create your cues.\r\nThis allows you to adjust for position differences and so on by\r\nreprogramming a few position palettes, rather than having to reprogram\r\nevery cue. Cues recorded with absolute values will need to be\r\nre-recorded, preferably using palettes.\r\n\r\nThe pan, tilt and dimmer will always be preserved from one fixture type\r\nto the next. For other attributes, the console will attempt to match the\r\nfunctions between the fixtures, but you can change the details of this\r\nusing the Exchange Mapping function (see [next section](./changing-the-patch.md#exchange-mapping)). All programmed\r\nitems including palettes will be preserved, so the programming can be\r\neasily adjusted by updating your palettes as normal.\r\n\r\nFixture exchange also gives you a powerful way to re-use an existing\r\nshow with new lights, so you can give yourself a programming head start\r\nwhen faced with a new fixture.\r\n\r\n-   It's a good idea to save your show before performing major changes\r\n    such as fixture exchange. Should you change your mind or have\r\n    problems, you will easily be able to return your show to its\r\n    previous state.\r\n\r\n1. Enter patch mode by pressing \\<Patch\\>.\r\n\r\n2. Select the new fixture type you wish to use.\r\n\r\n3. Touch the select button of the fixture which is to be exchanged.\r\n\r\n4. The console will warn you that the fixture is in use. Press the\r\n    \\[Exchange Fixture\\] option.\r\n\r\n5. Repeat from step 3 to exchange other fixtures with the same type\r\n    of new fixture.\r\n\r\n> After exchanging fixtures you need to update the palettes which used those fixtures. If you have trouble switching values off in a palette, set new values for all the attributes in the attribute group and re-record the palette. You should then be able to switch off an attribute group as required.\r\n\r\nExchange Mapping\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWhen you exchange fixtures the console will attempt to map the functions\r\non the new fixture to the same functions on the old fixture so that your\r\nshow does not look any different with the changed fixtures.\r\n\r\nHowever, this may not always work out quite right, so using Exchange\r\nMapping you can manually map functions between the fixtures. For example\r\nthis allows you to map the old gobos to similar new gobos even if they\r\nare not in the same wheel position, and to ensure that rotation speeds\r\nwork the same.\r\n\r\nAny changes made will apply immediately to the show. Mappings are\r\nremembered and will be used whenever you exchange the same fixtures in\r\nthe future (though you can restore to factory mappings at any time\r\nshould you need to using the \\[Clear All Mappings\\] softkey).\r\n\r\n![exchange\r\nmapping](/docs/images/exchange-mapping.png)\r\n\r\nTo set up mapping:\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<View/Open\\> then Patch to show the Patch View screen.\r\n\r\n2. Select the Exchange Mapping tab.\r\n\r\n3. In the leftmost column, click the fixture type of the new fixture\r\nwhich you have changed to.\r\n\r\n4. The view shows the old fixture on the left and the new fixture on\r\nthe right with attributes listed for both fixture types. You can sort\r\nthe list either alphabetically or in DMX channel order using the\r\n\\[Sort\\] context menu option.\r\n\r\n5. Select an attribute to show the mapping. The mapped attribute on\r\nboth fixtures will highlight in light blue. Brown controls are not\r\nmapped. The centre of the view shows the individual functions of the\r\nselected attribute, and coloured lines show how these map between the\r\nfixtures.\r\n\r\n6. To map a function, click on a source function then a destination\r\nfunction. Any previous mapping will be removed. You can map multiple\r\nsource functions to a single destination function.\r\n\r\n7. To unmap a function, double click the source function. If there are\r\nmultiple sources mapped, double click the destination function.\r\n\r\n8. To move a mapping, click the existing destination, then click the\r\nnew destination.\r\n\r\n-   Where a fixture has been exchanged from more than one source fixture\r\n    you can switch between them by selecting the relevant source fixture\r\n    under the \\'exchanged from\\' column.\r\n\r\n-   When you change the mapping, the \\'Unsaved Changes\\' options will\r\n    pop up at the bottom of the screen. Here you can store the new\r\n    mappings by pressing Apply, forget the changes by pressing Cancel or\r\n    restore all mappings to Avolites factory default by pressing Reset.\r\n    All these actions have to be confirmed by pressing the \\[Confirm\\]\r\n    softkey.\r\n\r\n![Exchange Mapping](/docs/images/Exchange-Mapping.png)\r\n\r\n**Range mapping**\r\n\r\nIf the destination function has a range (for example 0-100%) you can\r\nadjust the range to which the source function is mapped.\r\n\r\nWhere multiple source functions are mapped to a single destination\r\nfunction with a range, separate destination buttons are shown allowing\r\nyou to set a different destination range for each source function.\r\n\r\nTo set the range, first select a destination function, then click the\r\nEdit Ranges option at the bottom of the window. Then select the function\r\nwhose range you wish to change. (Note that it is only possible to adjust\r\nthe range of a mapped function. Any functions that are not mapped or are\r\nnot ranges will grey out). You can then adjust the maximum and minimum\r\nvalues for the range either by wheel, by touching the wheel view on\r\ntouch consoles or by selecting the relevant softkey and entering the\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nOnce complete, click Apply then \\[Confirm\\] to commit the changes or\r\nCancel then \\[Confirm\\] to forget.\r\n\r\nUpdating Patched Personalities\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis option allows you to update the personality for a fixture used in\r\nyour show. Normally a copy of each fixture personality in the show is\r\nsaved in the showfile, so updating the personality library on the\r\nconsole does not update fixtures which are already patched.\r\n\r\n-   It's a good idea to save your show before using Update\r\n    Personalities, then you will be able to undo any changes if you\r\n    change your mind or have problems.\r\n\r\n1. Enter patch mode by pressing Patch.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Edit Fixtures\\]\r\n\r\n3. Press \\[Update Personality\\] to update an individual fixture\r\n   type, or \\[Update All\\] to update all patched fixtures to the most\r\n    recent version in the library.\r\n\r\n4. If updating individual fixtures, the console shows you a list of\r\n    personalities used in the show which can be updated.\r\n\r\n5. If updating individual fixtures, press the personality you want\r\n    to update.\r\n\r\n-   The new personality is loaded from the Titan/Personalities folder.\r\n",

You cannot link fixture buttons. You can copy\r\nor move multiple fixtures in one operation.\r\n\r\nFixture copying is very useful if you need an additional fixture of a\r\ntype you've already patched and programmed because the new copy will\r\ncome complete with all the cues and palettes of the original fixture\r\nyou've copied. The copied fixture will be \"Parked\" (have no DMX channel\r\nallocated) so you will need to set an address before you can use it (see\r\n[changing the patch section](./changing-the-patch.md))\r\n\r\nMove is useful for tidying up the console.\r\n\r\n1. Press the \\<Copy\\> button.\r\n\r\n2. Select \\[Copy\\] or \\[Move\\]. Pressing the \\<Copy\\> button again will\r\nalso toggle through these options.\r\n\r\n3. Press the Select button of the fixture you want to copy/move. You\r\ncan select multiple fixtures -- use the \\<Thro\\> and \\<And\\> buttons to\r\nadd more fixtures to the selection.\r\n\r\n4. Press the empty Select button where you want it to go.\r\n\r\n-   The \\<Menu Latch\\> button latches the Copy/Move/Link menu, so you\r\n    can keep copying or moving things without having to keep pressing\r\n    the Copy/Move/Link button. Press again to unlatch.\r\n\r\n-   The \\[Retain Layout\\] or \\[Bunch Up\\] option is used when copying a\r\n    group of fixtures with empty handles in the group - you can either\r\n    keep the empty handles, or bunch up the used handles together. There\r\n    is also a \\[Bunch Up With Offset\\] option which allows you to leave\r\n    a gap in the DMX channels, if you are running a show where you need\r\n    to exchange fixtures to ones which use more DMX channels.\r\n\r\n-   When in Copy mode, option \\[Copy Legends\\] can be changed to \\[Don't\r\n    copy legends\\] so that the copied fixtures are given default\r\n    legends.\r\n\r\n-   When in Move mode, \\[Swap Items if Required\\] will attempt to\r\n    reposition any existing handles which are in the way of the move.\r\n    This is useful when rearranging buttons on a page which is nearly\r\n    full.\r\n\r\nDeleting a Patched Fixture\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can delete a fixture or dimmer from a button if you patched it\r\naccidentally or if you change your rig and want to use the button for\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n> All programming for the fixture is also deleted. You cannot undo deletion of a fixture or get the programming back by repatching a fixture to the same handle. If you might need the fixtures again later, move them to an unused fixture page.\r\n\r\n1. Enter Patch mode by pressing the \\<Patch\\> button.\r\n\r\n2. Press the \\<Delete\\> button.\r\n\r\n3. Press the Select button of the fixture you want to delete.\r\n\r\n4.

    "content": "---\r\nid: fixture-personalities\r\ntitle: Fixture Personalities\r\nsidebar_label: Fixture Personalities\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor each type of fixture, the console has a \"personality\" file which\r\ntells it how to control the fixture, which channel is the dimmer (HTP)\r\nchannel, and a large amount of other fixture-specific information. When\r\nyou patch each fixture, you tell the console which personality to use\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nThe console holds a personality library containing all commonly used\r\nfixtures, but new fixtures are appearing all the time and Avolites are\r\nconstantly updating the library.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you should update the library from time to time to\r\ntake advantage of new fixtures, as well as receiving bug fixes for\r\npersonalities and new features which may be added such as subfixtures.\r\n\r\nDownloading fixture personalities from Avolites\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Avolites website lists all fixtures for which personalities have\r\nbeen created. You should look here first if the console does not contain\r\na personality for your fixture. The address is\r\nhttp://personalities.avolites.com\r\n\r\n![Personality Website](/docs/images/Avolites-Personalities-Website.png)\r\n\r\nAll available fixture personalities are listed down the left side of the\r\nscreen. You can use the boxes on the top left to filter the list to show\r\nfixtures from specific manufacturers, or fixtures available for a\r\ncertain console, or to search for a specific fixture name.\r\n\r\nClick on the fixture name to open the details in the right hand window.\r\nThis shows all the personalities available for that fixture type (if you\r\nhave entered the console type on the top left, only personalities for\r\nthat console will be displayed).\r\n\r\nIf the personality is included in the standard library (cache) then the\r\ncolumn will be ticked.\r\n\r\nIf there is a personality listed for your fixture, the simplest thing to\r\ndo is to update the complete personality library as described in the\r\nnext section.\r\n\r\nUpdating the personality library on the console\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDownload the current Titan personality library by clicking on \"Titan\r\nFixture Library\" at the personality website home screen, or the disk\r\nicon in the Cache column for any fixture. Alternatively you can get this\r\nfile by clicking on the Download link at the top of the screen, then\r\nclicking on \"Titan Fixture Library\".\r\n\r\n> Updating will overwrite any custom personalities you have stored in the library. To avoid this, store your custom personalities in the user personalities folder (see next section for details).\r\n\r\n**To update a console use the following procedure:**\r\n\r\n1. Copy the downloaded file TitanFixtureLibrary.exe onto a USB pen\r\ndrive and plug in to the console.\r\n\r\n2. Click the \\'Tools\\' menu on the toolbar, then the folder icon on the\r\nmenu.\r\n\r\n3. Locate the downloaded file on the USB drive and double click on it\r\nto run it. Click \\'Ok\\' on the warning box.\r\n\r\n4. Shut down and then restart the console (using the Restart Software\r\nbutton on the screen Tools menu is OK).\r\n\r\n**To update Titan Mobile, Titan Go or Titan Simulator:**\r\n\r\n1. Locate the downloaded file TitanFixtureLibrary.exe and double click\r\non it to run it. Windows may show a warning about an unrecognised file\r\n\r\n2. Click \\'Ok\\' on the Windows User Account Control warning box.\r\n\r\n3. When the installation has completed, shut down and then restart the\r\nTitan software.\r\n\r\n-   The console caches the FixtureLibrary folder into memory when the\r\n    Patch option is first used, so you need to restart the console\r\n    software (from the Tools menu) to ensure new fixture personalities\r\n    are loaded.\r\n\r\n-   Once a fixture is patched, its personality is embedded in the show\r\n    file. Any changes to the fixture library will not affect fixtures\r\n    patched in the show. You can use the \\[Update Personality\\] option\r\n    in the patch menu to update patched fixtures if you need to.\r\n\r\nUser/custom personalities\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nUsing the Personality Builder application installed with the console\r\nsoftware, you can create your own personality if you wish to modify the\r\nbehaviour of a standard personality or you have a fixture the console\r\nhas never heard of and need to get it working quickly.\r\n\r\n> The console loads the fixture library into memory when the Patch option is first used, so after creating a new personality you need to restart the console software from the Tools menu or it will not show up.\r\n\r\nYou can incorporate your custom personality into the standard fixture\r\nlibrary on the console, however there is a danger that it will be\r\noverwritten when you next update the Fixture Library from Avolites.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this the console provides a special folder for user-provided\r\npersonalities located at: `D:\\Personalities`\r\n\r\nIf you are using Titan Mobile, Titan Go or the Titan Simulator, the\r\nfolder is located at: `\\Documents\\Titan\\Personalities`\r\n\r\nWhen patching fixtures, this folder is searched first before the\r\nlibrary. If a suitable Fixture Personality is found, the console will\r\nuse it rather than using the library. This folder is not affected when\r\nthe personality library is updated.\r\n\r\nRequesting a new fixture personality\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf a personality does not exist for your fixture, Avolites will create\r\none for you. Click on the \"Request\" link on the above web page to submit\r\nyour request. A list of current requests is shown, so you can check if\r\nsomeone else is asking for the same thing.\r\n\r\nYour new personality will be incorporated into the library -- to install\r\nthe new personality, download and install the latest personality library\r\nas described above.\r\n\r\nReporting a personality bug to Avolites\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you find a problem with a fixture personality, Avolites would like to\r\nknow about it so it can be fixed. Search for the personality on the\r\nwebsite then click on the \"Report Bug\" icon on the right of the screen.\r\nIf you click on the \"Bug Reports\" tab at the top of the window, a list\r\nis shown of currently outstanding problems, so you can check if someone\r\nelse has already reported the problem.\r\n\r\nIn an emergency\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe console contains a selection of \"Generic\" fixtures which you can use\r\nin an emergency if you need to operate a fixture with no personality.\r\nWhen patching, go through the manufacturer list until you find\r\n\\[Generic\\]. In this section (among other fixtures) are the following:\r\n\r\nMulti-DMX: Has up to 10 DMX channels, all channels are LTP. You can\r\nselect from 1-10 channels on the Mode screen. Press Attribute Bank and\r\nuse the softkeys to select channels.\r\n\r\nGeneric RGB: Allows you to control an RGB fixture such as LED colour\r\nchangers. This offers 5 modes:\\\r\n1=Dim 2=R 3=G 4=B\\\r\nVDim 1=R 2=G 3=B\\\r\n1=R 2=G 3=B 4=Dim\\\r\nVDim + 4xRGB\\\r\n4xRGB.\r\n\r\nVDim is a virtual overall dimmer channel for fixtures without a DMX\r\ndimmer control. When you use the Dimmer attribute the console will\r\nadjust the RGB levels accordingly.\r\n",

Press \\<Exit\\> when finished.\r\n\r\nInvert Attributes\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThis option inverts individual attributes of fixtures. Useful if you\r\nhave a fixture which pans right when the rest pan left, saving a trip up\r\nthe rig to set fixture options, but you can invert any attribute.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Patch\\>.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Edit Fixtures\\].\r\n\r\n3. Press \\[Invert Attribute\\].\r\n\r\n4. Select fixture(s) to be changed.\r\n\r\n5. Select the attribute to invert from the softkeys. The display shows\r\n\\[Inverted\\] when the attribute is inverted.\r\n\r\n6. Press \\<Exit\\> to finish.\r\n\r\n![Tilt Inverted](/docs/images/Tilt-Inverted.png)\r\n\r\n-   You can change the invert on multiple fixtures by selecting more\r\n    than one, but the \"Inverted\" display will not show if there is a\r\n    mixture of inverted and non-inverted fixtures in the selection.\r\n\r\n-   Some attributes cannot be inverted.\r\n\r\n-   Invert can also be set from the Attribute Behaviour tab of the Patch\r\n    View window.\r\n\r\nAttribute Limits\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nYou can set upper and lower limits for any attribute. This can be useful\r\nfor example to limit the pan/tilt movement of a fixture, or if a fixture\r\nhas a combined dimmer/strobe function and you only want the dimmer part\r\nof the operation.\r\n\r\nAttribute limits are set either from the Edit Fixtures menu or using the\r\nAttribute Behaviour tab of the Patch View window.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Patch\\>.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Edit Fixtures\\].\r\n\r\n3. Press \\[Set Limits\\].\r\n\r\n4. Select the fixtures to be set.\r\n\r\n5. Use the softkeys to select which attributes are to be set, then\r\nselect upper or lower limit.\r\n\r\n6. Input a percentage value for the limit value, or press \\[Set To\r\nCurrent Value\\]. To remove a limit press \\[Remove Limit\\].\r\n\r\n7. Press \\<Exit\\> when finished.\r\n\r\nFrom the Attribute Behaviour tab, use the context buttons to set\r\nAttribute Limits.\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to put values into the programmer outside the\r\nlimits. A \"limited\" watermark will appear on the wheel view behind an\r\nattribute when it is being limited.\r\n\r\n![limited](/docs/images/limited.png)\r\n\r\nFixture Offset\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nYou can set an offset to any attribute of any fixture. The normal use\r\nfor this is to correct pan/tilt positions when fixtures are rigged in a\r\ndifferent orientation to how they were programmed. The offset is applied\r\nto channels just before final output.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 ways to set an offset:\r\n\r\n-   Select fixture, \\<Locate\\>, then adjust attributes to the desired\r\n    locate value. Then press \\<Record\\>, \\<Locate\\>, \\[Update Offset\\].\r\n    This does not change the actual locate value but sets the difference\r\n    between the locate position and your set position as the offset.\r\n    This is an easy visual way to set the offset.\r\n\r\n-   You can also set offsets using palettes. Select fixture, apply\r\n    palette, adjust fixture to desired values then press \\<Record\\>,\r\n    \\<Palette\\>, \\[Update Offset\\]. Again this does not change the\r\n    palette, but sets the difference between the palette and the\r\n    position you changed it to as the offset value.\r\n\r\n-   In the Patch View window, in the Patched Fixtures list there are\r\n    cells for Pan or Tilt offset\r\n\r\n-   In the Patch View window, in the Attribute Behaviour tab you can\r\n    select \\[Offset\\] from the context menu buttons. This lets you view\r\n    or adjust offsets set by the first two methods.\r\n\r\nFixture / Attribute curves\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nCurves set how an attribute behaves over the full range of values. They\r\nare most often used for dimmer attributes to set the way the dimmer\r\nlevel follows a slider, but can be applied to any attribute.\r\n\r\nCurves are set either from the Edit Fixtures menu or using the context\r\nbuttons on the Attribute Behaviour tab of the Patch View window.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Patch\\>, \\[Edit Fixtures\\].\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Set Curve\\].\r\n\r\n3. Select the fixtures to be set.\r\n\r\n4. Use the softkeys to select which attributes are to be set.\r\n\r\n5. Use the softkeys to select the type of curve required. The normal\r\nsetting is Linear.\r\n\r\n6. Press \\<Exit\\> when finished.\r\n\r\nSee the [curves section](../system-settings/curves.md) for details of the different curves\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nFreeze Fixtures or Attributes\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThis option allows you to freeze individual attributes of a fixture, or\r\nto freeze the whole fixture. Attributes or fixtures which are frozen are\r\nnot affected by playbacks or by the programmer.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Patch\\>, \\[Edit Fixtures\\].\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Freeze Fixture or Attribute\\].\r\n\r\n3. Select the fixtures to be frozen/unfrozen.\r\n\r\n4. Use the softkeys to select which attributes are frozen, or to freeze\r\nthe whole fixture. Frozen attributes are indicated on the softkey.\r\n\r\n5. Press \\<Exit\\> when finished.\r\n\r\n-   Freeze can also be set from the Attribute Behaviour tab of the Patch\r\n    View window.\r\n\r\n-   A \"Frozen\" watermark is shown on the wheel display when an attribute\r\n    is frozen.\r\n\r\nEditing the Personality\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nSometimes you may want to modify the way a fixture behaves, or you may\r\nfind a fixture personality contains errors and needs editing. You can\r\nedit personalities directly on the console.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Patch\\>, \\[Edit Fixtures\\], .\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Edit Personality\\].\r\n\r\n3. The softkeys show a list of all fixture types patched in your show.\r\nSelect the fixture type to be edited.\r\n\r\n4. Personality Builder will open allowing you to edit the personality.\r\n\r\n5. When you save changes, your show will be updated with the edited\r\npersonality. Your changes are also saved to the fixture library on the\r\nconsole.\r\n\r\n-   Edited personalities will be saved in the User/Custom personality\r\n    folder at D:\\\\Personalities (if using Titan Mobile, Titan Go or a\r\n    simulator, the folder is at \\\\Documents\\\\Titan\\\\Personalities).\r\n    Personalities in this folder are searched and loaded before those in\r\n    the library and are not overwritten when a new fixture library is\r\n    installed.\r\n\r\n-   A separate user guide for Personality Builder is available from the\r\n    Avolites website.\r\n\r\n> If you find a problem in a fixture personality provided by Avolites, please let us know using the bug report form in the Personality section of the website.\r\n",

You can patch\r\nonto touch buttons in the Fixtures window, to a fader handle or to a\r\nMacro/Executor button. If the handle you patch to has a fader, the fader\r\nwill control intensity.\r\n\r\nIf the Fixtures window is not shown, press \\<View/Open\\> then\r\n\\<Fixture\\> or press \\<View/Open\\> then \\[Open Workspace Window\\] then\r\n\\[Fixtures\\].\r\n\r\n![Fixtures Window](/docs/images/Fixtures-Window.png)\r\n\r\nFixture buttons can be shown either in pages with Page buttons, or you\r\ncan use the scroll bar on the right to show different pages. Use the\r\n\\[Pages Show/Hide\\] button in the context buttons on the right of the screen to select between\r\npage buttons and scrolling mode (these buttons drop down using the menu button in the window\r\ntop bar for Sapphire Touch and Titan Go).\r\n You can change the fixture page at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nYou can allocate fixtures and dimmers to Groups, which allows you to\r\nquickly select a set of fixtures with one button. Groups are described\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\nOnce you have patched fixtures or dimmers, the [Patch View](./changing-the-patch.md#patch-view) screen shows\r\nyou an overview of what is patched where and lets you edit the patch.\r\n\r\nPatching Dimmers\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nEach fixture button can control single or multiple dimmer channels. You\r\nallocate a button using the Patch menu (described below) or the [Patch View](./changing-the-patch.md#patch-view) window.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Patch\\>, then \\[Dimmers\\].\r\n\r\n2. \\[DMX Line=\\] shows you which of the DMX output lines you are\r\npatching onto. Enter a new number to change the line. \\[Address = \\]\r\nshows the DMX address about to be patched. You can change this by typing\r\nin the new address on the numeric keypad and pressing \\<Enter\\>.\\\r\n![DMX Line](/docs/images/DMX-Line.png)\r\n\r\n3. To patch a single dimmer, press a Fixture touch button, a\r\nMacro/Executor button or the blue Select button of a fader handle. To\r\npatch a sequence of dimmers each to its own button, press \\[Quantity\\]\r\nand set the number of dimmers then press the first select button.\r\nAlternatively, run your finger or draw a selection box round the touch\r\nbuttons, or for physical buttons hold down the first button in the range\r\nand press the last button in the range. The range of dimmers will be\r\npatched to sequential DMX addresses.\r\n\r\n4. A fixture button turns dark blue and shows fixture details when it\r\nis patched. If you patch to a fader handle the select button will light\r\nup dimly.\r\n\r\n5. Repeat from step 2 for other dimmers.\r\n\r\n-   When setting the DMX address using \\[Address=\\], you can set the DMX\r\n    line (universe) as well by entering {line}.{DMX}, for example 2.56\r\n    will set DMX address 56 on DMX line 2.\r\n\r\n-   To see how DMX channels are patched, press \\<View/Open\\> then Patch\r\n    to show the [Patch View](./changing-the-patch.md#patch-view) window.\r\n\r\n-   \\[User Number = xx\\] allows you to set a user-defined number for\r\n    each dimmer or fixture patched, to help you identify them later. You\r\n    can also edit the User Number from the Repatch Fixture menu.\r\n\r\n-   You can patch multiple dimmer channels to a single handle. This can\r\n    be useful if, for example, you want to control all the lights for\r\n    one area together. To do this, just press the same Fixture Select\r\n    button again when patching the new dimmer channel. You can tell the\r\n    dimmer channel has patched OK because the DMX address will increase\r\n    by 1.\r\n\r\n-   If you need to remove a dimmer from multiple dimmers on a single\r\n    handle without losing programming, make a copy of the handle then\r\n    repatch the copy to the individual dimmer address.\r\n\r\nPatching Moving Light Fixtures\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nMoving light fixtures are more complicated to patch than dimmers because\r\nthey have more attributes to control, such as pan, tilt and colour,\r\nwhereas a dimmer channel just has intensity.\r\n\r\nAvolites consoles use a \"personality\" system to control fixtures. This\r\nmeans you don't have to know how each fixture works, you just tell Titan\r\nwhat you want to do and it will send the right control commands. The\r\nconsole has built-in personalities for most types of fixture, which tell\r\nit what attributes are available and how to control them. If the console\r\ndoes not have the personality for your fixture, you can download further\r\npersonalities from the Avolites website, create your own using the\r\nPersonality Builder application installed on the console, or Avolites\r\ncan create one for you. See the [personalities section](../fixture-personalities.md) for details of how to\r\nfind personalities.\r\n\r\nYou can patch either using the Patch menu (described below) or the [Patch View](./changing-the-patch.md#patch-view) window.\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Patch\\>.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Fixtures\\].\r\n![Patch Menu](/docs/images/Patch-Menu.png)\r\n\r\n3. Select the correct fixture manufacturer from the softkeys\r\n(\\[Previous\\] and \\[Next\\] page through the list of manufacturers). Or\r\nuse Quick Search and type the first few letters of the manufacturer's\r\nname on the keyboard to find the one you want.\r\n\r\n4. Select correct fixture from the softkeys (F and G show other pages).\r\nYou can use Quick Search here as well.\r\n\r\n5. Select the correct fixture operating mode from the softkeys.\r\n\r\n6. \\[Address =\\] shows the first free DMX address. Type the new address\r\non the numeric keypad if you want a different one. \\[DMX line=xx\\] lets\r\nyou patch to a different DMX line, or you can enter the address as\r\n\\[line\\].\\[address\\], e.g. 2.45 would set address 45 on line 2.\r\n![Address Input](/docs/images/Address-Input.png)\r\n\r\n7. Patch the fixture by pressing a Fixture touch button, a\r\nMacro/Executor button or the blue Select button of a fader handle (not\r\nthe main playback faders).\r\n\r\n8. A fixture touch button turns dark blue and shows fixture details\r\nwhen it is patched. If you patch to a fader handle the select button\r\nwill light up dimly.\r\n\r\n9. Repeat from 7 to patch more of the same fixture type. The DMX\r\naddress automatically updates so you can just keep patching by pressing\r\nSelect buttons.\r\n\r\n-   To patch multiples of the same fixture, use the \\[Quantity\\] option.\r\n    Or you can run your finger or draw a selection box round the touch\r\n    buttons, or for physical buttons hold down the first button in the\r\n    range and press the last button in the range. The fixtures will be\r\n    patched to sequential blocks of DMX addresses.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Options\\], \\[Offset\\] allows you to leave gaps in the DMX channels\r\n    between fixtures when patching multiple fixtures, which is useful if\r\n    you are planning a show which may involve exchanging fixtures. The\r\n    Offset number is the size of the block which will be allocated to\r\n    the fixture, for example if you want to allow 32 channels for each\r\n    fixture you would set Offset to 32.\r\n\r\n-   You cannot patch more than one fixture onto a handle. If the handle\r\n    is already used, the patch will fail.\r\n\r\n-   If you are patching a fixture which uses a separate dimmer channel,\r\n    such as a VL5, you can patch the dimmer channel onto the same handle\r\n    as the moving light part of the fixture so you can control it all\r\n    together. This is called a Pending Dimmer (in the [Patch View](./changing-the-patch.md#patch-view) window\r\n    this is indicated with a flash symbol behind the user number).\r\n\r\n-   \\[Options\\], \\[Preset Palettes\\] sets whether the console will\r\n    create default colour, gobo and position palettes for the new\r\n    fixture. These are created in the Position, Colour and Beam\r\n    workspace windows.. This option is turned off by default but can\r\n    give you a useful starting point.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Options\\], \\[AutoGroups\\] sets whether the console will\r\n    automatically create groups from the fixtures you patch. If Enabled,\r\n    a group is created for all fixtures of the same type, and another if\r\n    you patch a quantity of fixtures.\r\n\r\n-   To show the DMX address for fixtures, press \\<View/Open\\> then\r\n    \\<Patch\\>. To show patch details for a single fixture press\r\n    \\<View/Open\\> then the fixture select button. On touch buttons the\r\n    DMX address is displayed on the top right of the button in the\r\n    format {DMX line}.{Address} (this display can be disabled using the\r\n    context menu).\r\n\r\n-   If a patch goes over the capacity of a DMX line, the console will\r\n    patch at the beginning of the next line. For example if you try to\r\n    patch a moving head fixture at channel 1.510, it will actually be\r\n    patched at 2.1.\r\n\r\n-   The console will show a picture of the fixture you select in the\r\n    prompt area to help you check you have got the right one (if\r\n    provided in the fixture personality; some fixtures do not include\r\n    this information)\\\r\n    ![Fixture Mode](/docs/images/Fixture-Mode.png)\r\n\r\nCapture Visualiser Auto Patch\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Capture Visualiser, start it by pressing\r\n\\<View/Open\\> then \\[Open Workspace Window\\] then \\[Visualiser\\]. Some\r\nconsoles also have a dedicated \\<Visualiser\\> button. Capture will open\r\nin a workspace window with an automatic representation of your patch.\r\n\r\nYou will see the fixtures you have patched laid out on screen in handle\r\nnumber order. You can then use the [Visualiser controls](../capture-visualiser.md) to reposition the\r\nfixtures if you wish.\r\n\r\n-   You can turn off Auto Patch in the Capture Visualiser Settings\r\n    window (Stage tab).\r\n\r\n-   Fixture modes which will work with Auto Patch show a Capture icon in\r\n    the button. If the icon is not shown, that fixture mode isn't\r\n    supported in the integrated Capture.\\\r\n    ![Fixture Modes](/docs/images/Fixture-Modes.png)\r\n\r\n-   If you are using the [console linked to the full version of Capture](../capture-visualiser/linking-the-console-to-stand-alone-capture.md)\r\n    (Nexum or above) on an external computer, then changes to the patch\r\n    on the console will automatically sync to the Capture show. Also\r\n    changes you make in Capture will sync back to the console.\r\n\r\nPatching Fixtures with Multiple Cells (sub fixtures)\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSome fixtures have multiple cells of control within a single fixture\r\n(for example an RGB LED batten). To avoid having to patch every cell as\r\na single fixture, you can patch the whole fixture as one \"super fixture\"\r\nand each cell will then appear as a \"sub fixture\". This is very useful\r\nwhen laying out fixtures for use with the Pixel Mapper as it allows you\r\nto move and rotate the fixture as a single fixture, but keep individual\r\ncontrol over the cells.\r\n\r\nIf you access the fixture using the handle it is patched on, all cells\r\nof the fixture will be controlled together. To access the sub fixtures\r\nindependently, use the Attribute Editor window or you can press\r\n\\<Unfold\\> then the select button of the fixture. In the Fixtures\r\nworkspace, the current page of fixtures will be replaced by select\r\nbuttons for each individual fixture cell. If patched on a fader then the\r\ncells will start at fader 1. You can also select subfixtures from the\r\nnumeric keypad. See the [fixture control section](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#fixtures-with-multiple-cells-subfixtures) for more details of\r\nworking with fixture cells.\r\n\r\nTo go back to normal, press \\<Unfold\\> then \\[Exit Unfold\\].\r\n\r\n> The Sub fixtures feature has to be defined in the fixture's personality. If sub fixtures does not work on your fixture you may need to obtain the latest fixture personality from Avolites.\r\n\r\nPatching Active Fixtures / Media Servers\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFor Ai media servers see the [Synergy section](../synergy.md) which allows you\r\nto connect to Ai for control of the setup and media playback.\r\n\r\nOther media servers which support CITP can be patched using the \\[Active\r\nFixtures\\] command on the Patch menu. This allows the console to\r\nretrieve thumbnail images of the media clips to display in the Attribute\r\nEditor when you are selecting the clip to play.\r\n\r\nOnce the media server is connected to the network, selecting \\[Active\r\nFixtures\\] then \\[CITP Media Servers\\] will display a list of the\r\navailable display layers on the connected server(s). Each layer can then\r\nbe patched to a fixture button for control.\r\n\r\nPatching by RDM\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nRDM (Remote Device Management) is a system which allows the console to\r\ninterrogate the lighting rig to find out what's there. It can then patch\r\nitself to match the existing DMX addresses. You can also remotely change\r\nmodes and other settings on the fixture.\r\n\r\n> The fixtures need to be connected to the console by an RDM-enabled Artnet node, the XLR connectors do not support RDM. Obviously the fixtures must be equipped with RDM for this to work; many fixtures are not. Also if you have DMX buffers or splitters in your rig, they must be RDM enabled or they will block the information being sent back to the console.\r\n\r\nPress \\<View/Open\\> then \\<Patch\\> to open the [Patch View](./changing-the-patch.md#patch-view) window then\r\nselect the RDM tab. All devices which support RDM will be listed here.\r\nClick the \\[Full Discover\\] context menu button to rescan the rig for\r\nRDM devices.\r\n\r\n![RDM Discovery](/docs/images/RDM-Discovery.png)\r\n\r\n-   Select one or more fixtures in the grid and click the Patch context\r\n    menu button to patch the devices.\r\n\r\n-   Click on the Mode or Address cells in the grid to change these\r\n    settings remotely.\r\n\r\n-   Click on the Identify button (at the right hand end of the screen,\r\n    you might need to scroll to see it) to turn the fixture on so you\r\n    can see where it is in the rig.\r\n\r\n-   Click on the RDM Quick Patch context menu button to automatically\r\n    patch all RDM devices.\r\n\r\nFinding a Lost Fixture\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nSometimes a fixture may be rigged with the wrong DMX address set, or\r\nconnected to the wrong DMX line.\r\n\r\nThe Find Fixture function allows you to find the start address of the\r\nfixture by scrolling a \"locate\" state through all possible DMX\r\naddresses. When the fixture responds with its Locate state, you know its\r\nDMX address and might hopefully avoid a trip up the rig to look at it..\r\n\r\n1. Press \\<Patch\\>, \\[Fixture\\] and select the type of fixture you are\r\nlooking for\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Options\\], then \\[Find Fixture\\] to enable the Find Fixture\r\nmode.\r\n\r\n3. Turn Wheel B to go through all possible DMX addresses. Wheel A sets\r\nDMX lines.\r\n\r\n4. When the fixture responds with its Locate state, you have found the\r\ncorrect DMX address.\r\n\r\n4. Turn off \\[Find Fixture\\] mode and (if not already occupied) patch\r\nthe fixture. The DMX address/Line will be automatically set to match the\r\nFind Fixture settings.\r\n\r\n-   Wheel C (DMX Slot) jumps through DMX addresses using the fixture\r\n    channel count (for example if a fixture uses 16 channels, it will\r\n    jump through in 16's).\r\n",

To\r\nview the fixture pages, drag the Pages bar to the right.\r\n\r\nPress the **All** button to select all fixtures. Hold down the **All** button to\r\nstep through various selection patterns (odd, even etc).\r\n\r\n![Fixture Control in Titan Remote Android App](/docs/images/Fixture-Control-in-Titan-Remote-Android-App.png)\r\n\r\nThe wheels show function values (such as colours or gobo names). To go\r\nto the next function, just touch the arrows at the top or bottom of the\r\nwheel. To manually scroll the value, spin the wheel with your fingers.\r\nIf there are more than three functions, touch the **IPCGBES** button again\r\nto change to the other functions.\r\n\r\nPress the **Clear** button to clear the selection and all changes in the\r\nremote programmer. Hold down the **Clear** button to clear all programmers\r\n(for example if someone has been doing something on the console at the\r\nsame time, this will clear the console's programmer too).\r\n\r\nYou can also play back cues using the **Cue** screen. Hold down a playback\r\nbutton to kill or release an active playback.\r\n\r\n> If you update the legends of palettes or cues on the console while the remote is running, the legends on the remote will not be updated. \\<Exit\\> and restart the remote app to show legend changes made on the console.\r\n\r\nRecording groups and palettes\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can record groups and palettes using the **Rec** button on the remote,\r\nthen click a workspace button as normal.

You don't want someone in the audience taking over the show.\r\n\r\nYou may experience problems with the remote if you have an internet\r\nrouter on the network, as this may route show traffic to the\r\ninternet rather than between the remote and the console. If the\r\nremote does not work properly, disconnect your router from the\r\nnetwork.\r\n\r\nUsing an Existing Network\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are connecting to an existing network, DHCP will probably be\r\nenabled which will automatically set suitable IP addresses on the\r\nconsole and mobile device. All you should need to do is to plug the\r\nconsole's Ethernet connection into the network.\r\n\r\nIf the console is set to have a fixed IP address you will need to\r\nmanually set a suitable IP address for the network - *consult the person\r\nwho manages the network*, or read more about [Networking the Console](../networking.md).\r\n\r\nNetwork Setup using a Dedicated Access Point\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is a basic setup assuming that the console is connected directly to\r\nan access point. For information on setting up your Wireless Access\r\nPoint please refer to the documentation provided with it.\r\n\r\n> We advise using a dedicated wireless access point rather than a\r\nwireless router (ADSL router). Although routers are cheaper, the\r\nWiFi connection through to the Ethernet can be flaky. Some routers\r\ncan be switched to an *\"access point\"* mode to avoid this problem.\r\n\r\nYou need to set up the network settings on the Wireless Access Point,\r\nthe mobile device and the console so that they can communicate with each\r\nother. In this example we use an Android smartphone but other devices\r\nare similar.\r\n\r\n1. In the access point's admin screen, give the access point an IP\r\naddress such as `10.0.0.1`, make sure wireless is switched on and enable\r\nthe DHCP server. Take note of the name of the wireless network (SSID).\r\n\r\n2. Connect an Ethernet cable from the back of the console to the access\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n3. Set the IP address of the console: Switch to System, select\r\n\\[Network Settings\\], press \\[Local Area Connection\\], then press \\[Set\r\nIP 10.\\*.\\*.\\*\\].\r\n\r\n4. On the mobile device, go to WiFi settings or Network Settings and\r\nensure Wi-Fi is set to on.\r\n\r\n5. Select the wireless network from the list, the name you took note of\r\nearlier. The mobile device should automatically get an IP address from\r\nthe access point.\r\n\r\n6. Run the Titan Remote app. You should see the console listed.\r\n\r\n> If you are using the remote at showtime, on the Access Point you should select the option to hide the SSID. If you do not do this, every smartphone in the audience will find your wifi and try to connect to your Access Point which will make the remote operation very sluggish.",

The Titan system\r\nallows a number of consoles to be connected together to give an\r\nintegrated system with multiple control surfaces.\r\n\r\nIn addition, on many shows it is important to have a backup console\r\nrunning in case the main console fails during the show. Titan allows you\r\nto run a second console over the network which it keeps synchronised\r\nwith the main console. Should the worst happen, a single keypress can\r\ntransfer control to the backup console.\r\n\r\n> Linked consoles must be running the same version of Titan. If using PC Suite (Titan Mobile, Titan Go or Simulator) you may need to disable any firewalls on the PC.\r\n\r\nSetting Up Consoles for Multi-User\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nTitan consoles may be connected to each other for collaborative\r\nprogramming or show operation. See the [Multi-User Operation](../titan-basics/multi-user-operation.md) section for more information.\r\n\r\nSetting Up Consoles for Backup\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nAny Titan console can act as backup for any other console, they do not\r\nhave to be the same model. For example you could run Titan Mobile as\r\nbackup. You can also in an emergency use the screen on a TNP to operate.\r\n\r\nHowever do plan ahead and think about what parts of your show will\r\nbecome inaccessible if the backup device has less faders/handles than\r\nthe main console.\r\n\r\n1. Connect both consoles to the same network and ensure they are set to\r\nthe same IP range. See the [networking section](../networking.md).\r\n\r\n2. Press Disk, \\[TitanNet Sessions\\], \\[Backup\\].\r\n\r\n3. Consoles available for backup will be listed in the softkeys.\r\n\r\n4. Selecting a console will place that console into backup mode and\r\nsync the show to it.\r\n\r\n5. The backup console will show a display indicating the backup status\r\nand show name.\r\n\r\nIn backup mode the backup console screen displays the current connection\r\nand sync status including current show name.\r\n\r\n![TitanNet Backup Healthy](/docs/images/TitanNet-Backup-Healthy.png)\r\n\r\nA green line between consoles represents a\r\ngood connection. If a red line is shown there is a problem with the\r\nnetwork connection. A blue line will appear during sync operations.\r\n\r\n![TitanNet Backup Faulted](/docs/images/TitanNet-Backup-Faulted.png)\r\n\r\n-   Shows will automatically sync whenever a show is saved on the main\r\n    console (including autosave). You can also choose to sync at any\r\n    time by selecting \\[Sync Now\\].\r\n\r\n-   Pressing \\[Exit\\] will abort backup.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Takeover\\] will enable control on the backup console and disable\r\n    DMX output on the main console. A prompt will appear on the main\r\n    console to warn that DMX has been disabled. On touch consoles\r\n    touching on this prompt will open the \\'\\<Exit\\> Safe Mode\\' menu\r\n    with a softkey option to re-enable output.

You can either run the bridge software on the console itself or on an intermediate laptop.\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/vwr1DBJjBbw \"PioneerDJ Integration\")\r\n\r\nConnecting Titan to the Pioneer System\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou need to get the console and the Pioneer equipment connected to the same network. The Pioneer equipment has some limitations with its network IP address - it either needs to be assigned an address using DHCP or it uses an automatic address in the range 169.254.\\*.\\* - which means that if you are already using networking to control the lights (ArtNet or sACN) things can get a bit complicated as many lighting products cannot use that address range.\r\n\r\n**Pioneer Bridge running on the console**\r\n\r\nIf you aren’t using networking, or your console has two network interfaces, or you can adjust your lighting to a suitable address range, then you can run the Pioneer Bridge software on the console itself. If your console includes an ethernet switch, you can connect the “Extension” ethernet socket on the Pioneer equipment directly to the console, otherwise you need to go through an external switch.\r\n\r\nRun the Pro DJ Link Bridge software from the Tools \\> Additional Programs menu on the console.\r\n\r\n- You can set the Bridge software to run automatically when the console powers up using the Tools \\> Control Panel \\> Run on Startup menu option. This is useful in club environments where the console is always linked.\r\n\r\n![Pro-DJ link bridge command on shell menu](/docs/images/Pro-DJ-link-bridge-command-on-shell-menu-2.png)\r\n\r\nLook at the Interface tab of the bridge software to see what IP address is being used by the Pioneer equipment. You need to set the network interface on the console to use an IP address in the same range – if it is using DHCP, just set the console to DHCP as well, or if using the automatic addresses set a fixed address. For example if the bridge is set to 169.254.225.212 as in the image below, set the console to 169.254.225.1 (assuming nothing else on the network is using that address).\r\n\r\n![Pro-DJ link bridge command on shell menu](/docs/images/Pro-DJ-link-bridge-command-on-shell-menu.png)\r\n\r\n- Once you have everything connected up and have got all the IP addresses right, the bridge software should show connections for both the Titan console and the DJ mixer.\r\n- Some ArtNet / sACN equipment can be configured to run on the 169.254.\\*.\\* address range, in which case you can run everything on the same network.\r\n\r\n**Pioneer Bridge running on separate computer**\r\n\r\nIf you need to keep the Pioneer network separate to the lighting network and your console only has a single network port, or if you just prefer to have the bridge separate from the console, then you can download the bridge software from the Pioneer website and run it on a separate computer.\r\nIf you need two separate address ranges then your computer will need two network interfaces.\r\nOnce you have everything connected up and have got all the IP addresses right, the bridge software should show connections for both the Titan console and the DJ mixer.\r\n\r\nPioneer Workspace window\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom the \\[Open Workspace Window\\] menu, select the \\[PioneerDJ\\] option.\r\n\r\n![Pioneer Workspace window](/docs/images/Pioneer-Workspace-window.png)\r\n\r\nThe top of the window shows a big (detail) waveform and a small (full track) waveform for the current track. Multiple tracks can be shown one above the other.\r\nBelow that, details of the current track playing on each device is shown.\r\nAt the bottom, the connection status of the Pioneer equipment is shown – green when connected.\r\nYou can select which track is currently the Master by pressing the track number on the left or in the detail area at the bottom. A red “M” shows which track is the master. If you assign your trigger as “Master” this lets you quickly change which track is controlling the BPM.\r\n\r\nContext menu buttons allow you to show or hide the big and small waveform displays, the track details and the status bar. The other elements of the window will change to fill the space.\r\n\r\n![Pioneer context menu buttons](/docs/images/Pioneer-context-menu-buttons.png)\r\n\r\n- The \\[Zoom\\] button allows you to set the scale of the big waveform.  \r\n\r\n- The \\[Change Layout\\] button allows you to select the view in the workspace. This is useful if you want a smaller window:  \r\n\\[Full\\] – shows all the currently playing tracks  \r\n\\[Master\\] – shows only the waveform of the master track  \r\n\\[Condensed\\] -  shows details of all the tracks at the bottom, but only shows the waveform of the master track. You can change the master track by pressing the track number in the Track Details area.  \r\n\r\nSetting up BPM triggers from Pioneer\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou will need a fader on the console configured as a BPM master which will be automatically controlled by the track BPM playing on the Pioneer devices. See [BPM Master](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#bpm-master-options) section for how to set up a BPM master.\r\nEnter System mode and select \\[Triggers\\]. The Triggers window will open.\r\n1. Add a new mapping using the + button at the bottom of the left hand column, and enter a name such as “Pioneer”.\r\n2. Add a trigger to the mapping using the + button in the right hand column or softkey \\[Add trigger\\].\r\n3. Select \\[Trigger Type\\] as \\[Item\\].\r\n4. Press the button for the BPM master you want to control.\r\n5. The \\[Action\\] button will show \\[PioneerDJ\\] as this is currently the only action for a BPM master. Press \\[OK\\]. You have now set up the console action which is to be triggered.\r\n6. Now you need to select which Pioneer deck will control the BPM. Select \\[Deck=\\] as Master, 1, 2, 3, 4. \\[Master\\] will use the track you have currently selected as Master (red M displayed). The 1-4 options let you fix the control to one of the decks.\r\n7. Press \\[Add\\]. The trigger should now appear as shown below.\r\n\r\n![Trigger workspace with Pioneer trigger added](/docs/images/Trigger-workspace-with-Pioneer-trigger-added.png)\r\n\r\nNow you should see the BPM master automatically change to match the BPM of the track playing which you have selected as Master (or on the selected CDJ player if you selected a fixed player number).\r\n\r\n- To regain local control of the BPM master, switch off the “BPM triggers” switch at the bottom of the PioneerDJ workspace window.\r\n",

This is very useful in complex shows or when using in\r\nan automated setup.\r\n\r\nThe following types of trigger are available:\r\n\r\n- Audio (not on all console hardware)\r\n- DMX\r\n- GPIO (not on all console hardware)\r\n- MIDI\r\n- Streaming ACN\r\n\r\n> Audio trigger (sound to light) requires special hardware which is not fitted on Sapphire Touch,\r\nTiger Touch, Titan Mobile, T1 and Pearl Expert. You can plug a T2 into these consoles to provide\r\naudio triggering. The motherboard \"line in\" socket can't be used for audio trigger.\\\r\nGPIO trigger is only available on Arena.\r\n\r\nConnecting External Trigger Sources\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nAudio input is connected to the dedicated audio in jack (not the line in\r\njack on the motherboard) -- see information box above for consoles which provide this.\r\n\r\nDMX inputs are connected to one of the DMX output connectors using a DMX\r\nmale to male gender changer cable. (This is a simple plug to plug cable\r\nwith all pins wired straight through, i.e. 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3). Titan\r\nMobile may require an update of the USB Expert software to enable this\r\nfunction, this can be downloaded from the Avolites website.\r\n\r\nGPIO uses a contact closure for trigger which is connected using a dedicated jack socket, currently only on the Arena console.\r\n\r\nMost console hardware has a standard 5-pin MIDI connector, also USB-MIDI devices supporting the DirectX MIDI driver may be\r\nused on all consoles except T1. For the T2 this allows you to\r\nconnect a MIDI fader controller to give you real playback faders.\r\n\r\nsACN is connected using the normal Ethernet connection on the console.\r\n\r\n\r\n- You can link a networked PioneerDJ system to Titan to automate BPM masters; this is described in the next section. This replaces the old “Pro DJ Tap” function.\r\n\r\nSetting up External Triggering\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nEnter System mode and select \\[Triggers\\]. The Triggers window will\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n![Triggers Window](/docs/images/Triggers-Window.png)\r\n\r\nThe left hand side of the window has a list of trigger Mappings, where each mapping\r\ncan contain one or more trigger setups. A default\r\nset is provided for MIDI Show Control which includes standard show control \r\nmessages (see next section for details).\r\n\r\nEach trigger mapping can be enabled or disabled using the \"power\" button\r\nat the left hand end of the mapping name. This allows you to configure the\r\nconsole to react in different ways and easily swap between them.\r\n\r\nThis is how you set up a trigger:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new mapping using the + button at the bottom of the left hand\r\ncolumn, and enter a name for it.\r\n\r\n2. Add a trigger to the mapping using the + button in the right hand\r\ncolumn or softkey \\[Add trigger\\].\r\n\r\n3. Select \\[Trigger Type\\] as \\[Hardware\\] or \\[Item\\].\\\r\n**Hardware** triggers a physical or touch button, or fader move, and\r\nwill use the key profile set for the button/fader, just as if the user pressed the button or moved the fader.\\\r\n**Item** triggers a programmed item, such as a cue or chase, but you can select\r\nwhat action happens to it when it is triggered.\r\n\r\n4. Press the button or move the fader to be triggered, or containing the item to be triggered. The status area of the screen will\r\nupdate to show you what has been triggered. For Item triggers you can\r\nselect what action the trigger will cause, using the \\[Action\\] softkey:\r\n\t-\tSet Level \r\n\t-\tFire At Level\r\n\t-\tRe-Fire at Level (see below for explanation of Set, Fire and Re-Fire)\r\n\t-\tFlash\r\n\t-\tSwop\r\n\t-\tPreload\r\n\t-\tLatch \r\n\t\r\n\tThe \\[Level Match\\] option sets what happens if the playback is already active when the trigger happens.\r\n\tIf set to **On** then the trigger must match the current playback level before it will take effect. If **Off** (default) the\r\n\ttrigger will override the playback at any level.\r\n\r\n5. Press \\[OK\\]. You have now set up the console action which is to be\r\ntriggered.\r\n\r\n6. Now you need to set up the external stimulus which will cause the\r\ntrigger. Select \\[Trigger Type\\] as Audio, DMX, GPIO, MIDI or Streaming ACN. \r\n\r\n7.\tBy default the \\[Learn\\] option is set to On, so you can generate the stimulus from your device (for example play the MIDI\r\n\tnote, or turn on the DMX channel) and the console will automatically detect it and set the correct values. \r\n\r\n\tOr you can enter the trigger details using the softkey options.\r\n\t-\tFor Audio, set the \\[Band\\] (frequency band) for the trigger (see [Audio Control](./midi-dmx-or-audio-triggering.md#audio-control-sound-to-light))\r\n\t-\tFor DMX, press\r\n\t\t\\[DMX Port\\] to select which DMX port you are using for DMX input. You\r\n\t\twill need to switch the DMX port to Rx mode using the menu option\r\n\t\tprovided. Set the DMX address to act as trigger using the \\[Address\\] button.\r\n\t-\tFor GPIO, you can \\[Invert\\] the trigger (to trigger on contact open rather than close).\r\n\t\tThe Pin option allows multiple GPIO inputs but currently no consoles support this, so it should be set to 1.\r\n\t-\tFor MIDI, set the MIDI channel, MIDI Command, Value, and Level (velocity) ranges\r\n\t-\tFor sACN, select the \\[Universe\\] and \\[Address\\] for the trigger.\r\n\r\n8. Press \\[Add\\] to add the trigger to the list.\r\n\r\n9. The window will show the trigger stimulus and the action to be\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nYou can continue to add other triggers to the mapping.\r\n\r\n![Triggers Window with MIDI triggers](/docs/images/Triggers-Window-with-MIDI-triggers.png)\r\n\r\n-\tTo delete a trigger from the mapping, select it in the list and press\r\n\tthe rubbish bin button at the bottom.\r\n\r\n-\tTo delete a complete mapping, select it and press the rubbish bin button\r\n\tat the bottom of the left hand column.\r\n\t\r\n-\tSet Level, Fire At Level and Re-Fire At Level set how the playback behaves when fired.\\\r\n\tSet Level and Fire At Level both fire the playback at the trigger level, but once fired\r\n\tchanges in the trigger level will just adjust the intensity levels in the playback.\\\r\n\tRe-Fire At Level will cause the playback to be re-fired when the trigger level changes, so\r\n\tany LTP values in the playback will be set again. So for example if the playback sets\r\n\tfixtures to red, but then another playback changes the colour to white, the Re-Fire option would set\r\n\tthe fixtures back to red when the trigger level changes, but the other two options would leave them\r\n\tat white and just change the intensity.\\\r\n\tFire At Level allows you to fire a cue at 0 which can be used to turn off a cue list, if the cue list\r\n\toption is set to Kill At 0.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n",

Ensure your MIDI device is connected and recognised by Windows\r\n(you can use a utlity such as Midi-OX to test it).\r\n\r\n1. Enter System mode and select \\[Triggers\\].\r\n\r\n2. Add a new mapping using the + button at the bottom of the left hand\r\ncolumn, and call it \"T2 playbacks\".\r\n\r\n3. Add a trigger to the mapping using the + button in the right hand\r\ncolumn or softkey \\[Add trigger\\] -- by default this is set to the\r\ncorrect Trigger Type of \\[Hardware\\].\r\n\r\n4. Move playback fader 1 on Titan Go.\r\n\r\n5. Click \\[OK\\]\r\n\r\n6. Move the first fader on your MIDI controller. Titan Go should\r\nrecognise the MIDI commands and display the trigger in the prompt area.\r\n\r\n7. Click \\[Add\\]. The trigger for playback 1 is added to the list on\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\n8. Repeat from \\[3\\] to add the other 9 playback faders.\r\n\r\nMIDI Show Control\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe following MIDI Show Control messages are supported:\r\n\r\n  Command   | Action\r\n  --------- | ---------------------------------------\r\n  GO        | Fire the specified playback or cue\r\n  STOP      | Pause the specified playback or cue\r\n  RESUME    | Un-pause the specified playback or cue\r\n  LOAD      | Set the playback level to full\r\n  ALL OFF   | Release all playbacks\r\n  RESET     | Same as ALL OFF\r\n  GO OFF    | Same as resume\r\n\r\nPlaybacks/Cues are identified by their User Number. To set the user\r\nnumber, press \\[Set Legend\\] then the select button of the cue, then\r\n\\[User Number\\].\r\n\r\nMIDI show control devices are identified by a device ID. To set Titan's\r\ndevice ID go to System mode and select \\[User Settings\\], then go to the\r\n\\[Timecode\\] tab. The default setting is 0.\r\n\r\nAudio Control (Sound to Light)\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nOn supported consoles the audio input is divided into frequency bands\r\nwhich can be used to provide the trigger. The \\[Band\\] option selects\r\nwhich of the bands is being used.\r\n\r\nAudio triggers are adjusted in the Audio Triggers workspace.\r\n\r\n![Audio Window](/docs/images/Audio-Window.png)\r\n\r\nIf the console does not have suitable hardware a warning message is\r\ndisplayed. Currently only the Quartz and Arena consoles have the audio\r\nhardware.\r\n\r\n-   The Enable switch below the gain slider disables all audio triggers\r\n\r\n-   The left hand gain slider sets the overall input gain, which can be\r\n    used to boost weak signals\r\n\r\n-   Auto gain will automatically adjust the gain, this disables the\r\n    slider from manual changes\r\n\r\n-   The Enable switches below each band disable triggers on that\r\n    particular band\r\n\r\n-   Trigger level sets the threshold for triggering on each band. The\r\n    band shows red when triggered.\r\n\r\n-   The Auto switches on the bands automatically adjust the trigger\r\n    level on each band when no triggers are occurring.\r\n\r\nYou can quickly allocate a playback to a trigger by clicking the top\r\nBand button above the trigger, then select the playback to be triggered.\r\n\r\nOn the Arena console, the Audio LED (just above the power switch) will\r\nflash when audio is received. Note that the headphone socket on the\r\nArena is linked to the motherboard audio output and can't be used for\r\nmonitoring the audio trigger input.\r",

It is wise to also make a separate copy of show by saving it to a USB drive, enabling you to swap to a different console if there are\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nLabel the console\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nWhen you are running your show you will need to know where everything is. Use the Legend functions to set onscreen labels, or you can't beat the low tech method of marker pen and tape.\r\n\r\nGrand Master fader and assignable masters\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf the console is fitted with a Grand Master Fader, this controls the intensity of all output from the console. Normally you would use it to quickly fade out all the lights.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master fader is disabled by default. It can be enabled in the User Settings if required.\r\n\r\nThe Pearl Expert has additional master faders: Swop and Flash masters control intensity of the swop/flash buttons; Preset master controls intensity of the preset faders; Playback master controls intensity of all playbacks.\r\n\r\nAny playback fader on the console can be assigned to act as a master fader, which allow you to set the overall intensity of various areas of the console. Different types of master fader are available:\r\n\r\n-   **Grand Master** controls the intensity of all output from the console.\r\n\r\n-   **Swop and Flash masters** control intensity of the swop/flash buttons\r\n\r\n-   **Preset master** controls intensity of the preset faders\r\n\r\n-   **Playback master** controls intensity of all playbacks.\r\n\r\nTo assign master faders, go to System mode and select \\[Assign Mastering\\], or press \\<Record\\> then \\[Create Master\\].\r\n\r\nBy default, master faders are set to have a transparent lock, which makes the master fader remain in position even when the playback page is\r\nchanged. If you don\\'t want this to happen you can change it by pressing \\<Options\\> (or \\[Options\\] softkey from the root menu) then press the Swop/Select button of the master.\r\n\r\nOn the Arena console, the rotary encoders on the Mini Screen are very useful as speed masters or group masters - press the encoder to select\r\nit as a master. Press the Display button below the encoders to show legends for the encoders on the screen if they are not already shown\r\n(there are 4 display modes to cycle through).\r\n\r\n![Arena Miniscreen](/docs/images/Arena-Miniscreen.png)\r\n\r\n>  If you assign a master to a handle with an LED, the LED will flash if the fader is at zero... just as a reminder to help you work out why no lights are coming on.\r\n\r\nSpeed and Size Masters\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/e5rQAmTCfs0?t=20 \"Speed and Size Masters\")\r\n\r\nPlaybacks can be assigned to a Speed Master and/or a Size Master which allow you to control the speed and size of shapes or effects stored in a cue (or in the case of chases, to modify the speed of the chase).\r\n\r\nThere are eight possible Speed Masters and four Size Masters which allow you to separately control the parameters of different playbacks, if you need to – for example Rate Master 1 could be assigned to control position shapes, Rate Master 2 to dimmer shapes, and so on.\r\n\r\nA playback is assigned to a Speed/Size Master by pressing \\[Effects\\] then \\[Speed Source\\] or \\[Size Source\\] in the playback Options. The following speed sources are available:\r\n\r\n-   Free Run (default - no Speed Master. Effect runs at programmed speed)\r\n\r\n-   BPM 1-4 (override the local speed with a fixed value from the master)\r\n\r\n-   Rate 1-4 (proportionally modify the local speed using the master)\r\n\r\n-   LocalClock - the playback is set to Tap Tempo mode and all other speed settings are ignored. Using Key Profiles you can assign one of the playback buttons to \\[Tap Tempo\\] mode, and then set the effect speed by tapping the button. Effects will synchronise to the tap.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Rate Grand Master which, if used, proportionally controls the four Rate Masters (BPM Masters are not affected).\r\n\r\nTo use Speed or Size Masters you will need to assign some handles on the console to act as the Master faders. Switch the console to System mode and select \\[Assign Mastering\\]. Special key profile options are\r\navailable for Speed Masters, BPM Masters default to Tap Tempo.\r\n\r\nSpeed or Size masters can have various scales, 0-100%, 0-200% and so on. A 0-200% scale would allow you to slow down and speed up the speed to double the programmed setting. Scales are set in normal (non-system) mode by pressing \\<Options\\> (or \\[Options\\] softkey) then press the Select button of the master.\r\n\r\n",

This allows you to create a set of playbacks which automatically switch off other playbacks in the same group. This can be useful when you have playbacks on executor buttons so only the most recent playback stays active, or to make life easier when busking so you don’t end up with lots of playbacks fired which have superseded each other.\r\nSee section [Playback Groups](../cues/playback-groups.md)  for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixture Group Masters\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nYou can assign a fader to control the master intensity of each fixture group.

When you are ready for the new state, you fade the Scene Master fader to the other end of its travel and the new state is output.\r\n\r\nYou assign a fader to be Scene Master from the \\[Assign Mastering\\] menu in System mode. The Scene Master is set to Live mode by default which means that all changes are immediately output as usual.\r\n\r\n![Scene Master (Live)](/docs/images/Scene-Master-Live.png)\r\n\r\nTo enter preset mode, press the blue button of the Scene Master. The display above the master will show \"Preset\" and the background turns purple.\r\n\r\n![Scene Master (Preset)](/docs/images/Scene-Master-Preset.png)\r\n\r\nNow any changes you make -- firing playbacks, stepping cue lists, applying palettes and so on -- will only be shown on the visualiser. Everything you change for the preset will also turn purple on its display.\r\n\r\nWhen you fade the Scene Master the state you preset will be faded to the output. If times are programmed for cues or palettes they will also run. Once the fader has reached the end of the travel, the new state is \"committed\" to the output, or you can press the grey button to manually commit the new state.\r\n\r\nNormally the Scene Master will auto-reverse so you can just keep\r\npresetting new states, moving the fader alternately up and down. You can\r\nalso set it to require you to move it back to zero each time. Press\r\n\\<Options\\> (or \\[Options\\] softkey) then the Select button of the master. The options\r\nare:\r\n\r\n-   \\[Auto Commit and Invert\\] Commits the changes once the fader has\r\n    reached the end of travel. You can then preset a new state and fade\r\n    the fader the other way to output it.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Auto Commit\\] You always have to fade from 0 to 100% to output the\r\n    new state. The changes are committed at 100% and you then have to\r\n    lower the fader to 0% to preset the next state.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Manual Commit\\] The new state does not commit at 100% and if you\r\n    move the fader back to 0 the output state will go back to what it\r\n    was before. You need to manually commit the changes using the grey\r\n    button (the button can be changed using Key Profiles).\r\n\r\nA Scene Master can also be set on executor buttons or touch buttons in\r\nthe Playbacks workspace. In this case, hold \\<Avo\\> (or Release) and\r\npress the button to enter or exit preset mode, and press the button on\r\nits own to commit the preset to the output, You can view the state of\r\nthe Master by opening the Static Playbacks workspace.\r\n\r\nYou can assign the buttons to do different things using Key Profiles --\r\nthe options are Exit scene mode, Enter scene mode, Commit changes,\r\nCommit changes and exit scene mode, Enter or Exit scene mode, Enter or\r\ncommit scene mode.\r\n\r\nFlash and swop buttons\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe Flash and Swop buttons on a playback fader may be used at any time\r\nto flash and solo cues and chases. The Flash button adds the playback\r\ninto the current output, the Swop button turns off all other output.\r\nThe Flash button can also be set to Timed Flash which will use the\r\npre-programmed timings of the cue when flashing -- for normal flash mode\r\nthe timings are ignored.\r\n\r\nYou can reallocate the functions of the Flash and Swop/Select buttons on\r\nthe console using [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md). A useful\r\nalternative function is Preload which allows you to pre-position the\r\nattributes of the fixtures before you raise the playback fader, which is\r\nhandy for avoiding unwanted movements (any fixtures which are already\r\nactive in another playback will not change when you use Preload). You\r\ncan also allocate Go and Stop buttons for cue lists and chases. To\r\nquickly change the key profile, hold \\<Avo\\> Shift and press \\[Edit Key\r\nProfile\\]. The Sapphire Touch also has a configurable Black button for\r\neach fader.\r\n\r\n![Playback Faders with key profiles applied](/docs/images/Playback-Faders-with-key-profiles-applied.png)\r\n\r\nThe screen relating to each playback fader\r\nshows the allocated function of the blue and grey buttons.\r\n\r\nPlayback priority\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n[You can set playbacks to high priority](../cues/playback-options.md#playback-tab) if you do not want them to be\r\noverridden by other playbacks using the same fixtures. For example, if\r\nyou have a couple of fixtures acting as a spotlight, but they are also\r\nprogrammed into some colour washes, you probably want the spotlight cue\r\nto take priority over the colour washes.\r\n\r\nVirtual faders\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nIf you need more playbacks and you're happy to operate them on a touchscreen fader, you can use the\r\nVirtual Faders workspace window (press \\[Open Workspace Window\\] then select \\[Virtual Faders\\]). \r\nThis provides 10 more paged faders which work exactly the same as the hardware playback faders. \r\nA roller display at the left side allows you to select different pages.\r\n\r\n![Virtual playbacks window](/docs/images/virtual-faders.png)\r\n\r\nPress the Settings (cog) button at the top of the screen to\r\n\r\n- Show or hide the page select roller\r\n\r\n- Show or hide the blue, grey and black buttons\r\n\r\n- Set how many faders are shown per page. This can be set to 5, 10 or 15 to match the playback fader\r\nlayout on the console hardware.\r\n\r\nPreset playbacks (Tiger Touch only)\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nOn the Tiger Touch, as well as the 10 playback faders across the bottom\r\nof the console, there are 10 further playbacks on the top right of the\r\nconsole. These are not affected by the playback page buttons and so are\r\nuseful for memories you use a lot, such as par can washes, basic stage\r\nillumination or smoke machines.\r\n\r\nYou can switch to different pages for the preset playbacks using a\r\nfactory-preloaded macro in two of the Macro/Executor buttons. This macro\r\nis loaded with the Personality Library, if you do not see the page\r\nmacros you need to update the library.\r\n\r\nLocking a playback onto the same handle on every page\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSometimes you might want to keep a playback accessible on a handle no\r\nmatter which page you are on. The \\[Handle Paging\\] option in the\r\n\\[Options\\] menu lets you do that without having to copy the\r\nplayback onto multiple pages.\r\n\r\n- \\[Locked\\] ensures the playback always appears on that handle no matter\r\nwhat page is selected. Any other playbacks programmed on that handle on\r\nother pages will not be accessible.\r\n\r\n- \\[Transparent Lock\\] means the playback will appear on the current page\r\nonly if the handle is empty on that page. If the handle is in use on the\r\nnew page, then that playback will appear instead of the locked one. This\r\ncan be useful if you only need the locked playback to appear on certain\r\npages but wish to reuse the handle on other pages.\r\n\r\nYou can also lock Palettes stored on the grey handle buttons, and macros\r\nstored on the macro/executor buttons which is useful with the Macro page\r\nchange buttons.\r\n\r\nLock options are also available for master faders.\r\n\r\nViewing active playbacks\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Active Playbacks window shows details of which playbacks are active.\r\nThis provides an easy way to see what is currently running.\r\n\r\nThe top line of the button shows the page number and tells you where on\r\nthe desk the playback is stored. The second line shows the legend, and\r\nthe third line shows which attributes are affected by the playback.\r\n\r\n![Active Playbacks Windown](/docs/images/Active-Playbacks-Window.png)\r\n\r\nClick on a playback to instantly kill it. You can also press \\[Playback\r\nOptions\\] followed by the playback in this window to change parameters\r\nof the playback.\r\n\r\nBlind mode\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you want to program palettes or cues using the visualiser without\r\naffecting the look on the stage, you can set the console to Blind mode.\r\nJust press the \\<Blind\\> button (on consoles which don't have a\r\ndedicated button, hold down the \\<Avo\\> button and select \\[Blind\\]).\r\n\r\nTo preview a playback, you need to set the playback into Blind mode --\r\nhold the \\<Blind\\> button and press the playback select button. Repeat\r\nthis to restore the playback to Live mode. You can also set Blind mode\r\nin playback Options.\r\n\r\nYou can convert Blind output to Live output with a fade. This is useful\r\nto set up a live state in blind mode then output it without having to\r\nsave to a playback. It also allows you to select multiple palettes then\r\nfade to them all at once. (Scene Master is probably an easier way of\r\ndoing this however).\r\n\r\nTo convert blind to live, type a number to set fade time then press the\r\n\\<Blind\\> button.\r\n\r\nIf any attribute fade times have been set in the programmer, these will\r\nbe used instead of the fade time you type.\r\n\r\nBusking with palettes\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nIf you have not had as much programming time as you would have liked,\r\nyou might need to make up some additional effects during the show. This\r\nis sometimes called \"busking\", and is where the fun starts!\r\n\r\nYou can create instant variations by recalling palette values to modify\r\nyour existing cues. Palette values can have fade times saved with them,\r\nor you can set a fade at showtime for added effect.\r\n\r\n1. Select some fixtures which are already in use on stage.\r\n\r\n2. Type \"2\" (or any time, in seconds) on the numeric keypad.\r\n\r\n3. Touch a Palette button to recall a palette.\r\n\r\n4. The selected fixtures will change to the new palette over a time of\r\n2 seconds.\r\n\r\nIf the palette contains programmed times, you can change the Key Profile\r\nof the palette button to set whether the programmed times will be used\r\nor not. (Press \\<Avo\\> Shift+\\[Key Profiles\\], then \\[Palettes\\] to set\r\nthe key profile). Options are \\[Palette is fired ignoring its times\\] or\r\n\\[Palette is fired with its times\\]. You can also set whether the\r\npalette will take precedence over a flashed cue or not. A time entered\r\nmanually as above will always override a programmed time.\r\n\r\nWhen a fade time is entered on the numeric keypad, you can also change\r\nthe Fixture Overlap using the \\[Overlap\\] softkey. This allows you to\r\ncreate \"roll\" or \"peel\" effects when using a series of fixtures. With\r\noverlap=100%, all fixtures change at the same time. If overlap=50%, the\r\nsecond fixture will not start its fade until the first fixture is half\r\nway (50%) through fading. The order of the fixtures is set by the order\r\nin which you selected them.\r\n\r\nThe palette fade time remains active while the Palette Fade menu is\r\nopen. Press \\<Exit\\> to leave the menu and return to instant palette\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\nIf you apply a palette as a \"Quick Palette\" (i.e. without selecting any\r\nfixtures) then it will be overridden by the next cue (so if you fade to\r\ngreen using a Quick Palette, then fire a cue which sets those fixtures\r\nblue, they will go blue). If you apply a palette after selecting\r\nfixtures, it will go into the programmer and override any subsequent\r\ncues until you press \\<Clear\\>.\r\n\r\nWhen programming your palettes, group all the colour palettes in one\r\narea of the console, position palettes in another area, and so on. This\r\nhelps you to find them when the show is running and the pressure is on.\r\n\r\nIf you are lighting a band, make position palettes for every person on\r\nstage so you can spotlight them for those unplanned solos.\r\n\r\nYou can use the [Off](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#clearing-attributes-using-off) function when programming to set some cues to only affect position, and other cues to\r\nset colours, gobos, add shapes, and so on. By combining two or more cues\r\nyou can produce a much wider range of effects than if all your cues set\r\nall the attributes. However, for this to work well you need to make sure\r\nyou know what attribute is going to be affected by each cue; as if you\r\nfire two \"colour only\" cues then nothing is going to light up.",

When a track is added it automatically\r\nlinks to the current page. Pressing the play button next to the track\r\nwill automatically select the correct playback page (except on Pearl\r\nExpert, because the rollers cannot be moved automatically).\r\n\r\nCreating a Set List\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nTo create a Set List, click the plus button in the top right corner of\r\nthe window. You can choose Empty, Pages, and Build. Pages will\r\nautomatically create a set list using the legends of your existing\r\nplayback pages, one page per track. Build allows you to select the pages\r\nin the order you want them. Or you can manually add a track using the\r\nplus button below the track list.\r\n\r\nConfiguring Tracks\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nEnter notes by selecting a track and clicking the text entry button,\r\nbottom right, or the Edit Note context menu button.\r\n\r\n-   You can temporarily remove a track from the set list using the Park\r\n    Track context menu button.\r\n\r\n-   If you prefer to operate by using the Page+/Page- buttons, you can\r\n    change the function of these buttons to step through the tracks in\r\n    the set list window, using the Page Mode context menu button. When\r\n    Page Mode is set to Set List, the Page+/Page- buttons are reassigned\r\n    to step through tracks in the Set List, and the playback pages will\r\n    automatically change as programmed in the Set List. Set Page Mode to\r\n    Normal to restore normal operation. (Not available on Pearl Expert).\r\n\r\n-   You can copy, move and delete tracks using the appropriate function\r\n    buttons on the console.\r\n\r\n-   You can change the legend of the Set List or of individual tracks\r\n    using the \\[Set Legend\\] option.\r\n\r\nTrack Workspace and Macro links\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can trigger macros and workspace shortcuts from tracks using the\r\n\\[Workspace\\] and \\[Macro\\] buttons in the bottom right hand corner of\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nTo add a workspace link to the current track, click \\[Workspace\\], then\r\neither click a workspace shortcut or press the \\[Record Workspace\\]\r\nsoftkey to save the current workspace.\r\n\r\nMacros can be added either to the whole Set List or just to the current\r\ntrack. Set List macros will fire every time a new track is selected,\r\nthis is useful for setting the console to a preset state at the start of\r\nevery song. Track macros will just fire for that individual track.\r\n\r\nTo view or edit the workspace links and macros, click the Workspace &\r\nMacros tab on the right hand half of the window.

You can also create new media banks on\r\nthe server. Media content will be automatically transcoded to the AiM\r\ncodec as required by the Ai system. This is very handy when you are\r\nhanded a last-minute media file at the front of house position.\r\n\r\n![Ai Media Browser Window](/docs/images/Ai-Media-Browser-Window.png)\r\n\r\nOn the left hand side of the screen, local disks available on the\r\nconsole are listed. If you plug in a USB drive it will be shown here.\r\nShortcuts to commonly used folders are also provided.\r\n\r\nIn the second column, the files/media clips available on the selected\r\nlocal disk are shown. You can navigate into folders and use the up arrow\r\nat the top to go back up a folder level.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the screen, the media banks on the Ai server are shown.\r\nClicking on the bank name will drop down the list of media clips loaded\r\nin the bank. Click the **+** button at the side of the bank name to add a\r\nnew bank. At the top of this column, the available disk space and the\r\npath on the Ai server where the media is being stored is shown.\r\n\r\nTo copy media files to the Ai server, select the files you want to\r\ntransfer in the middle window, then click on the bank you want to\r\ntransfer them to on the server.\r\n\r\nIf the Ai server already has files on it with the same names as files\r\nyou have selected for transfer, the files will be highlighted in red in\r\nthe Ai server window as a warning.\r\n\r\n![Ai Media Browser uploading content](/docs/images/Ai-Media-Browser-uploading-content.png)\r\n\r\nSynergy will attempt to transfer the files as fast as it can and will\r\nshow you a progress screen. This may slow down the network; if this will\r\nbe a bad thing, turn on the **\"Bandwidth Saver\"** switch at the bottom of\r\nthe screen to throttle the file transfer and leave capacity on the\r\nnetwork for other traffic (obviously this will slow down the file\r\ntransfer).\r\n\r\nYou can also turn off the automatic transcoding to AiM codec, but\r\nnormally we would recommend that this option is left on. Once the files\r\nare uploaded, any requiring transcoding are added to a queue in Ai. You\r\ncan see the progress of the transcoding by viewing the clips in the\r\n[Attribute Editor](#attribute-editor-for-controlling-ai-layers), see below.\r\n\r\nMedia Viewer\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe Video Multi View window allows you to view any of the layers being\r\nproduced by the Ai server, or any of the combined surface outputs. In\r\naddition you can view any other NDI streams available on the network, so\r\nfor example at a broadcast event the broadcaster could feed you the\r\nprogram output or individual cameras to check lighting levels.\r\n\r\n![Video Multi View Window](/docs/images/Video-Multi-View-Window.png)\r\n\r\nTo add a stream, click on a view in the window (blank views show a plus\r\nsymbol). A screen will pop up showing you all available streams on the\r\nnetwork - either direct views of the layers, or a view of the output\r\nscreen with the layers combined.\r\n\r\n![Video Multi View Window adding a stream](/docs/images/Video-Multi-View-Window-adding-a-stream.png)\r\n\r\nThe context button \\[Change Layout\\] gives you various possible layouts\r\nof multiple screens. The \\[Titles Shown\\] button toggles to show or hide\r\nthe stream titles at the bottom of the views.\r\n\r\n![Video Multi View Window laout options](/docs/images/Video-Multi-View-Window-laout-options.png)\r\n\r\nYou must have the **\"Automatic NDI preview\"** option enabled for the Ai\r\nserver in the [Synergy Settings](setting-up.md#synergy-setup) window for this to work.\r\n\r\nThe NDI streams used for video preview can use a lot of network\r\nbandwidth which limits how many streams you can receive at one time. The\r\ndata rate varies depending on the detail/movement in the video but a\r\nrough guide is:\r\n\r\nFormat | Data Rate\r\n---|---\r\n1920x1080p30 | 120Mbps\r\n1920x1080p60 | 200Mbps\r\n3840x2160p30 | 280Mbps\r\n3840x2160p60 | 480Mbps\r\n\r\nAttribute Editor for Controlling Ai Layers\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOnce you have selected one or more Ai layers to control from the [Synergy\r\nFixtures window](setting-up.md#synergy-fixtures-window), the Attribute Editor lets you play back and manipulate\r\nmedia on those layers (you can also use the [wheels](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md) and [Attribute Bank\r\nbuttons](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#attribute-wheel-display)).\r\n\r\n> The most important attributes are **Intensity**, which set the output level\r\nof each layer, and **Media Selection** which lets you choose the Bank and\r\nClip to play. But you can also control all other functions of Ai such as\r\nadding FX and colour.\r\n\r\n![Clip tab of Attribute Editor for Synergy layer](/docs/images/Clip-tab-of-Attribute-Editor-for-Synergy-layer.png)\r\n\r\nIn the Media selection screen, in the Clip tab, if you click on the\r\n**T** button *(top right)* or the caption at the top of the tab, this will toggle\r\nthe clip name display on and off. This can be useful for long names\r\nwhich obscure the picture; on the other hand if you have lots of\r\nclips which look similar, the name display can be useful.\r\n\r\nSome of the attributes, such as FX Select, have a large number of\r\noptions which initially are shown in a vertical column of buttons\r\nrequiring a lot of scrolling to see all the buttons. If you click in\r\nthe header above the buttons, the column will expand to fill the\r\nwindow, making selection easier.\r\n\r\n![FX tab of Attribute Editor for Synergy layer](/docs/images/FX-tab-of-Attribute-Editor-for-Synergy-layer.png)\r\n\r\nIn the FX attributes, the effects names are pulled live from the Ai\r\nserver. This means the names you are shown will always match what's\r\non the server. It's also good for generative plugins where you\r\ndefine the Fx names.\r\n\r\n> If you select layers then press \\<Locate\\>, the layer intensity will be set to full but all media and fx will be cleared. This is useful to get a layer back to a known state, but you don't get any output. **To get some output you will need to then select a media clip**.\r\n\r\nThe Clip selection window also shows you the progress of clips being\r\ntranscoded by the Ai server.\r\n\r\nCurrently being transcoded | In the queue awaiting transcoding | Transcoding failed\r\n---|---|---\r\n![Video currently transcoding in Attribute Editor for Synergy layer](/docs/images/Video-currently-transcoding-in-Attribute-Editor-for-Synergy-layer.png) | ![Video queued for transcoding in Attribute Editor for Synergy layer](/docs/images/Video-queued-for-transcoding-in-Attribute-Editor-for-Synergy-layer.png) | ![Video failed to transcode in Attribute Editor for Synergy layer](/docs/images/Video-failed-to-transcode-in-Attribute-Editor-for-Synergy-layer.png)\r\n\r\nYou can [create palettes](../palettes/creating-palettes.md) to control Ai, just like with any other\r\nfixture. So colour, zoom, position and so on can be stored in a\r\npalette and used to quickly modify the appearance of the media.\r\n[Palette fade times](../palettes/timing-with-palettes.md) will also operate as you would expect.\r\n\r\nLightmap: Pixel Mapping Ai Media Content\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOften you might want to output video content to lighting fixtures\r\npatched on the console (for example if you have LED screens with\r\nfixtures around or in between them). The pixel mapper can directly play\r\nback media clips from the Ai server. These can be sourced from\r\nindividual layers or from surfaces (combined layer outputs).

You\r\njust need to open a blank show in Ai and you can add Screens and Layers\r\nfrom the Titan console.\r\n\r\nFor more complicated requirements, create suitable screen fixtures in\r\nthe Ai show - see the Ai manual for more details on how to do this. You\r\ncan create and rename Layers from the Titan console. The screen fixtures\r\nyou have created in Ai will then become available as Surfaces in Titan.\r\n\r\nSynergy Setup\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIn Titan, open the **Synergy Settings** window using the Workspace button\r\nprovided on new shows, or use the option in the Open Workspace Window\r\nmenu.\r\n\r\nThis window is a little like the [DMX settings screen](../system-settings/the-system-menu.md#dmx-settings): it lets you set up\r\nhow the Titan console is linked to the various outputs on the Ai\r\nserver(s). Also, it lets you add or remove layers from each Ai surface\r\nand add complete new surfaces to the Ai server (though you may need to\r\nconfigure these further on the Ai server itself).\r\n\r\n![Synergy Settings Window](/docs/images/Synergy-Settings-Window.png)\r\n\r\nOn the left of the screen the available Ai\r\nservers are shown. In the centre of the screen, the Surfaces and Layers\r\nconfigured in Titan are shown. Connection lines show how the Titan\r\nSurfaces will control the different outputs of the Ai server. At the\r\nbottom are Surfaces which are already configured on Ai but are not yet\r\nlinked to Titan, these are called unmatched surfaces.\r\n\r\nClick on the **+** at the bottom and select Surface from the pop up to add a\r\nnew surface. This will appear at the top; by default it has two layers\r\nbut you can change this later.\r\n\r\n![Synergy Settings Window screen settings](/docs/images/Synergy-Settings-Window-screen-settings.png)\r\n\r\nClicking on the top part of a Surface will\r\nshow options on the right for the surface. These options allow you to\r\nset the canvas resolution which can either be picked from a list of\r\ncommon resolutions, or entered numerically; at the top right the display\r\nhalo colour of the surface can be set, and the pencil button allows you\r\nto change the name (you can also do this with the \\[Set Legend\\]\r\nbutton).\r\n\r\nClicking on a Layer within a Surface shows layer options on the right.\r\nThis allows you to allocate a Rate or BPM master to the layer for speed\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nWhen no Surfaces or Layers are selected, the right side of the screen\r\nshows general information about the system. There is a switchable option\r\n\"Automatic NDI Previews\" to enable or disable NDI streams - if you are\r\nusing the media preview window, you will need to turn this on. If not\r\nleave it turned off, as it causes a lot of network traffic.\r\n\r\nOnce you have created a surface in Titan, you need to match it to the Ai\r\nsurface. Click on the Link button on the unmatched surface at the\r\nbottom, then click on the Screen 1 surface at the top (or you can click\r\n**\"Link to new Surface\"** to automatically create a new surface and link to\r\nit).\r\n\r\n![Synergy Settings Window linking a screen](/docs/images/Synergy-Settings-Window-linking-a-screen.png)\r\n\r\nThe Screen 1 Surface will now show that it is linked to the Ai server and the unmatched server at the bottom disappears.\r\n\r\n![Synergy Settings Window with a linked screen](/docs/images/Synergy-Settings-Window-with-a-linked-screen.png)\r\n\r\nYou can link the Screen 1 Surface to one or more different physical\r\noutputs on the Ai server by clicking the screen, then clicking the\r\noutput to connect on the left, for example if you want to show the same\r\nmedia on several screens.\r\n\r\nOnce a layer is linked, if you open the layer properties in Ai the\r\n**\"Synergy Control\"** box will show *\"Enabled\"*. Now you cannot control the\r\nscreen using Ai, only from the Titan console.\r\n\r\n![Avolites Ai Layer Adjustments](/docs/images/Avolites-Ai-Layer-Adjustments.png)\r\n\r\nTo add a layer, click on the surface, then the **+** button at the bottom\r\nand select **Layer** from the popup.\r\n\r\nTo delete a layer or surface, select the item then click the **Trash Can**\r\nicon at the bottom, or press \\<Delete\\> then click the layer/surface. If\r\nlinked to Ai, this will also delete the layer/surface in Ai.\r\n\r\nSynergy Fixtures Window\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nEvery layer on the Ai server appears as a button in the Synergy Fixtures\r\nwindow. You can display this using the button at the bottom of the\r\n[Synergy Settings window](#synergy-setup) or from \\[Open Workspace Windows\\].\r\n\r\n![Synergy Fixtures Workspace Window](/docs/images/Synergy-Fixtures-Workspace-Window.png)\r\n\r\nYou use these buttons to select one or more layers for control, just as\r\nyou would select lighting fixtures to control. Once selected, use the\r\n[Attribute Editor](operating-synergy.md#attribute-editor-for-controlling-ai-layers) or [wheels](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#changing-attributes-using-the-wheels) to control the media playback and effects on\r\nthe Ai server. You can then [store palettes](../palettes/creating-palettes.md) and [playbacks](../cues/creating-a-cue.md#creating-a-cue) as with any\r\nother lighting fixture. This is described in the next section, [Operating Synergy](operating-synergy.md).\r\n\r\n> The Synergy layers are shown in their own window to keep them\r\ntogether and help you find them quickly.

This off-loads the DMX\r\nprocessing, allowing the console to control up to 64 universes of DMX in\r\ntotal.\r\n\r\n> The software does not actually limit the number of universes from a\r\nsingle console to 16, but performance of the console will be\r\ndegraded. A warning will be shown in the processing load section of\r\nthe TitanNet overview.\r\n\r\nConfiguring DMX Outputs\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nSwitch the console to [System mode](the-system-menu.md) and select \\[DMX Settings\\].\r\n\r\nThe screen will initially show the node tab relating to the console\r\nitself. It shows a list of available DMX *nodes* (places where you can\r\nsend the DMX to) on the left, and a list of the available DMX *lines*\r\n(outputs generated by the console) on the right. Each DMX line can send\r\ndata to one or more nodes. If you assign more than one node to a line,\r\nthose nodes receive duplicated data. If you have ArtNet/sACN nodes or\r\nTNP units connected they will show on the left hand side.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand side, under each DMX Line there is a list of which\r\nnodes are linked to that line. The default setting on a new show is for\r\nthe physical DMX outputs on the console to be linked to the first DMX\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n![DMX Settings Window](/docs/images/DMX-Settings-Window.png)\r\n\r\nYou can individually assign Nodes to Lines using the arrow button, or\r\nassign all Nodes of the same type using the group assign button. For\r\nexample, to assign each XLR output socket on the back of the console to\r\na DMX line, you would click on the Group Assign button of the ExpertDMX\r\nnodes.\r\n\r\n![Node in DMX Settings Window](/docs/images/Node-in-DMX-Settings-Window.png)\r\n\r\nTo assign a node to a line, click on the **arrow on the node** (the node\r\nwill be highlighted), then click the line you want to assign to it.\r\n\r\nTo delete a node from the DMX lines, click on the **X** button. To delete\r\nall nodes from a line, click on the **Group delete button**.\r\n\r\nYou can show information about the DMX nodes, or the DMX lines, by\r\nclicking the **i** button. For Ethernet/network type nodes, this allows you\r\nto set detailed properties such as IP address ranges and net masks.\r\n\r\n![DMX Output in DMX Settings Window](/docs/images/DMX-Output-in-DMX-Settings-Window.png)\r\n\r\nIf you have [TNPs](../titan-net.md) connected, these can be individually configured using\r\nthe tabs across the top of the screen.\r\n\r\n > When transferring shows between different console types, and especially when you have used the simulator, it's a good idea to check the DMX output settings to make sure the settings are what you expected. If you created a new show on the simulator, no outputs will be connected.\r\n\r\n\r\nModule Properties\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nA module is a method of sending DMX (such as ArtNet, or sACN) and can be\r\nthought of as a collection of nodes.\r\n\r\nYou can set properties for ArtNet or sACN by going to the DMX Settings\r\nwindow (switch to [System mode](the-system-menu.md) and select \\[DMX Settings\\]) and then\r\nclick the cog icon at the right hand side of the module name.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to adjust settings for each module, and to select which\r\nnetwork adapter to use to output the protocol. All consoles except\r\nQuartz and Expert have two network adapters, Quartz has one, and on\r\nTitan Mobile and Simulator this depends on your computer; many laptops\r\nwill have a wired network adapter and also a Wi-Fi (wireless) adapter,\r\nboth of which will be shown.\r\n\r\n",

The console software can be reloaded\r\nusing the recovery USB stick provided with the console, or you can\r\ndownload a recovery disk creator application from the [Downloads section of\r\nthe Avolites website](https://www.avolites.com/software/latest-version) which will automatically create a recovery stick.\r\n\r\n> It may take up to 60 minutes to reinstall the software on the console.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of recovery available:\r\n\r\nRecovery | Version installed | Shows | Personalities | Licence\r\n---|---|---|---|---\r\nStandard Recovery | Two most recent | Preserved |Preserved | Preserved\r\nFactory Restore | Recovery version + most recent | Deleted | Recovery version | Preserved\r\nFull Erase | Recovery version | Deleted | Recovery version| Deleted\r\n\r\n> Using **Factory Restore** or **Full Erase** will delete all settings and files from the console including show files and user personalities. Any files should be saved to a USB stick before continuing.\r\n\r\nDetailed instructions on creating and using a recovery stick can be\r\nfound with the recovery creator on the [Avolites website](https://www.avolites.com/software/); depending on\r\nthe variety and age of your console there are a number of different\r\nmethods required. The basic procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n1. **If recovering a version earlier than v11.1**, you will need to set the\r\nconsole to boot from USB *(see instructions on the [Avolites website](https://www.avolites.com/software/),\r\nwhich vary depending on your console)*\r\n\r\n2. Start console and wait while the memory stick boots up, this can\r\ntake up to 3 minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Once the memory stick has booted, the touch screen will display\r\n\\'Welcome to (Console Name)\\', touch **Next** to continue.\r\n\r\n4. Please read to the bottom of the licence agreement then touch **Agree**\r\nto accept.\r\n\r\n5. Select the type of recovery you want to perform *(see table above)*\r\n\r\n6. On the next screen check the serial number of the console - this is\r\nthe number written on the back of the console and should be already\r\nfilled in for you.\r\n\r\n7. Touching **Install** will then begin the recovery\r\n\r\n8. Once complete unplug the memory stick and touch the **Restart** button.\r\n\r\nAfter starting the console will install all the software and drivers\r\nrequired to run. This takes approximately 30 minutes to complete during\r\nwhich the console will reboot a number of times. Please do not switch\r\noff the console during this process.\r\n\r\nSoftware Licensing\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nFrom v12, the software is licensed using an AvoKey USB device.\r\n\r\nThe Authenticator wizard will take you through the steps to license the\r\nsoftware on your console or computer. Once the license is stored on the\r\nAvoKey, you should not need to repeat the licensing. For Titan Mobile or\r\nT1/T2 dongles, this allows you to use different computers without\r\nrelicensing as long as the Avolites hardware is connected.\r\n\r\nFor more details see https://www.avolites.com/avokey\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/86PcC0OzL7E \"Licensing\")\r\n",

This includes details\r\nabout faults that occur, statistics on how long certain functions take,\r\nand usage of functions. This information is really useful for improving\r\nthe software, however if you would prefer to disable it, click the\r\n\\[Telemetry Enabled\\] button to switch it to \\[Telemetry Disabled\\].\r\nTelemetry information will only be sent in any case if the console is\r\nconnected to the internet.\r\n\r\nDisplay Setup\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis option gives you a menu for enabling and disabling [external\r\nmonitor(s)](external-displays.md).

You\r\ncan also change the way some of the touch keys work. You can save your\r\nsettings as a [Key Profile](../system-settings/key-profiles.md). Different profiles can be selected for\r\ndifferent users or to enhance the operation of the console for a\r\nparticular use.\r\n\r\nKey macro buttons\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nLighting programming can sometimes require a repeated sequence of button\r\npresses. You can record sequences of keypresses and play them back with\r\na single keypress -- this is called a macro. The macro can reproduce the\r\ntiming of your button presses (Real Time mode) or just repeat the\r\nsequence of buttons with no timing (Full Speed mode).\r\n\r\nReal Time mode is useful when you are using a macro to reproduce a\r\nlighting effect, for example a sequence of flash buttons. Full Speed\r\nmode is more useful for admin tasks such as changing console mode.\r\n\r\nMacros can be stored in the dedicated buttons on the top right of the\r\npanel, on the grey handle buttons, and in the Macro button window which\r\ncan be shown in the workspace. The top right panel macro buttons\r\ncorrespond to the first 20 macros in the window (10 on Tiger Touch).\r\n\r\nThe Arena also has two additional Macro buttons on the bottom left\r\ncorner of the console.\r\n\r\nTo record a macro:\r\n\r\n1. Press the \\<Macro\\> button (above keypad)\r\n\r\n2. Select \\[Full Speed\\] or \\[Real Time\\].\r\n\r\n3. Press \\[Record\\]\r\n\r\n4. Press a suitable empty button on the panel, or an empty button in\r\nthe Macro window on the screen. Recording starts. The Insert/Macro\r\nbutton flashes during recording.\r\n\r\n5. Press the sequence of buttons you want to record.\r\n\r\n6. Press \\[Record Macro\\] to finish recording.\r\n\r\nTo play back the macro, just press or touch the button where you\r\nrecorded the macro. The macro will repeat all your button presses, with\r\ncorrect timings if you selected Real Time mode.\r\n\r\nKeyboard shortcuts\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nMany features of the console can be controlled by shortcuts on the\r\nkeyboard. These are especially useful when using Titan Mobile or Titan\r\nSimulator.\r\n\r\nThe Titan application \"captures\" the keyboard on start up, meaning that\r\nif you try to use other applications at the same time they will not\r\nreceive keypresses. Pressing Break on the keyboard releases the keyboard\r\nfor other applications but disables all text entry for Titan including\r\nthe shortcut keys; changing menus will reconnect the keyboard to Titan.\r\n\r\nKey | Action | | Key | Action\r\n---|---|---|----|-----\r\n  F1 | Open user manual | |          Ctrl X |   Cut text\r\n  F2 | Activate window  | |          Ctrl C |   Copy text\r\n  F3 | Minimise/Maximise  | |         Ctrl V |   Paste text\r\n  Shift F3 | Next window  | |              Ctrl A |   Select all text\r\n  F4       |  Size/Position         | |    Ctrl Z |   Undo\r\n  Shift F4 |  Move to other screen  | |     Ctrl Y |   Redo\r\n  F5       |  Close window          | |     Alt C  |   Clear\r\n  Shift F5 |  Close all windows     | |     Alt R  |   Record menu\r\n  F6       |  Open Playbacks window | |     Alt A  |   Toggle Avo (shift) menu\r\n  F7       |  Open Fixtures window  | |     Alt L  |   Locate\r\n  F8       |  Open Groups window    | |     Alt P  |   Patch\r\n  F9       |  Open Colours window   | |     Alt D |  Disk menu\r\n  F10      |  Open Positions window | |     Alt S |  System mode\r\n  F11      |  Gobos/Beams window    | |     Alt V   |  Open/View menu\r\n  F12      |  Open Channel Grid     | |     Alt G   |  Go\r\n  Esc      |  Exit menu             | |     Alt D   |  Delete\r\n  Enter    |  Enter                 | |     Alt C |  Copy\r\n  Alt 1    |  Softkey A             | |     Alt M |    Move\r\n  Alt 2    |  Softkey B             | |     Alt U  |   Unfold\r\n  Alt 3    |  Softkey C             | |     Alt I  |   Include\r\n  Alt 4    |  Softkey D             | |     Alt R |  Release\r\n  Alt 5    |  Softkey E             | |     Alt S  |   Shape\r\n  Alt 6    |  Softkey F             | |     Alt T  |   Fixture Tools/ML Menu\r\n  Alt 7    |  Softkey G             | |    Alt B  |   Blind\r\n  Alt ⇑ F  |  Fixture               | |    Alt O  |   Off\r\n  Alt ⇑ P  |  Palette               | |     Alt F  |   Fan\r\n  Alt ⇑ M  |  Macro                 | |     Alt O |  Attribute options\r\n  Alt ⇑ G  |  Group                 | |     Alt L |  Latch menu\r\n  / (num)  |  Thro                  | |     Alt ←  |   Previous fixture\r\n  \\* (num) |  @                     | |     Alt →  |   Next fixture\r\n  \\- (num) |  Not                   | |     Alt ↑  |   All\r\n  \\+ (num) |  And                   | |     Alt ↓  |   Highlight\r\n\r\n⇑ means shift\\\r\n(num) means on the numeric keypad\r\n\r\nLocking the console\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nYou can place a simple lock on the console controls to prevent people\r\nfiddling with it while you're not looking. Hold down \\<Avo\\> and press\r\n\\[Lock\\], then type a password (numbers or letters). To unlock, enter\r\nthe password again, or restarting the console will also unlock it. After\r\na few seconds, the \"Enter password\" prompt will fade out but will appear\r\nagain if you press buttons or touch the screen. This is not a\r\nhigh-security lock, it's just to prevent passing idiots messing with it.\r\n\r\nYou can set a background image for the lock screen from the Lock Screen\r\nBackground option in the General tab of User Settings (hold \\<Avo\\>,\r\npress \\[User Settings\\]). The image can be either loaded from a picture\r\nfile or drawn using the touch screen.\r\n\r\nIf you load a picture file, the menu option \\[Scaling Mode\\] sets how\r\nthe picture will be scaled to fill the screen.\r\n\r\n-   None: Image is displayed 1:1\r\n\r\n-   Letterbox: scales the image until it fills either the width or\r\n    height of the screen, leaving black bars on the other edges of the\r\n    screen.\r\n\r\n-   Fill: scales the image until it fills the whole screen, keeping the\r\n    aspect ratio\r\n\r\n-   Stretch: scales the image until it fills the whole screen, ignoring\r\n    the aspect ratio\r\n\r\nThe \\[Clear\\] softkey will remove the image.\r\n\r\nWhile the console is locked, all functions are disabled except the DMX\r\noutputs and currently running playbacks.\r\n",

The console will also autosave the show\r\nperiodically.\r\n\r\n> Shows created on a Titan console can be loaded into any other model of Avolites Titan console, but not to older non-Titan consoles as the showfile format is different. \\\r\n  Showfiles from newer versions of Titan may not load correctly (or at all) into consoles with older versions of Titan.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough your show is safe on the hard disk, it's a good idea to also\r\nsave it to a USB pen drive which you can take with you in case something\r\nbad happens to the console or if you want to transfer a show to a\r\ndifferent console.\r\n\r\nSaving the show\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nYou can save your show at any time either with its current name or with\r\na new name. If you save your show with its current name, a new version\r\nof the show will be created. This allows you to go back to previous\r\nversions of your show if needed.\r\n\r\nTo save your current show:\r\n\r\n1. Press the \\<Disk\\> button.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Save Show\\].\r\n\r\n3. If you have a USB drive connected, use the softkeys to select\r\nwhether to save on \\[Removable Disk\\] or \\[Internal hard drive\\].\r\n\r\n4. If this is a new show, enter a name for the show on the keyboard. If\r\nthis is a new version of an existing show you can enter a tag to help\r\nidentify the version, which will be shown on the Show Browser screen\r\nwhen you load shows.\r\n\r\n5. Press \\<Enter\\> or \\[Save\\] (or \\[Overwrite\\] if the show already\r\nexists). The show will be saved.\r\n\r\n6. Press \\<Exit\\> or \\[OK\\] to leave Disk mode.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n-   To save the show under a different name, use the \\[Save As\\]\r\n    softkey.\r\n\r\n-   Pressing the \\<Disk\\> button twice will make the console save a\r\n    Quicksave version of the file. A Quicksave is just a version of the\r\n    show saved with the same filename.\r\n\r\n-   A new version of the file will be saved even if you enter the same\r\n    tag as previously used.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf you save to hard drive, shows are saved in the folder 'D:\\\\Shows' (on\r\nTitan Mobile, Titan Go and Simulator the folder is\r\n'Documents\\\\Titan\\\\Shows').\r\n\r\nLoading a show\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe console will automatically reload the last show when it is turned\r\non.\r\n\r\n![Show Browser](/docs/images/Show-Browser.png)Press the \\<Disk\\> button then \\[Load\r\nShow\\] to load in a new show. The Show Browser window will appear.\r\n\r\nOn the top left you can select which drive is used, or show files on all\r\ndrives. On the bottom left you can filter the list of shows to see all\r\nshows, or just manual saves, quick saves or autosave files. On the right\r\nyou can see different versions of the showfile; this allows you to\r\nreload an earlier version if you need to.\r\n\r\nYou can also load shows from the softkeys:\r\n\r\n1. Press the \\<Disk\\> button.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Load Show\\].\r\n\r\n3. If you have a USB drive connected, select which drive you want to\r\nload from.\r\n\r\n4. Available shows are listed on the softkeys; press the key to load\r\nthe show (the F and G keys show more pages). If you type the first few\r\nletters of the show name on the touch keyboard, the list will only\r\ninclude shows starting with those letters, which can make it easier to\r\nlocate the show you want.\r\n\r\n5. If there are multiple versions of the show stored on the disk,\r\nselect the one you want.\r\n\r\n6. Press Load Show. The console will show a loading screen as the\r\ndifferent elements of the show load.\r\n\r\n7. When the show has loaded the normal operating screen will reappear.\r\n\r\nWhen loading a show you have the option to keep the existing DMX\r\nsettings of the console, or to load the settings stored in the showfile.\r\nThe DMX settings determine how the XLR sockets on the back of the\r\nconsole are used and how DMX is sent over the network using TitanNet.\r\n\r\nImporting parts of other shows\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are doing a show which is similar to a previous one, you might\r\nwant to import parts of the previous showfile, for example you might\r\nwant the palettes for some Robe Robins from another show, but not the\r\nother fixtures. This is where the Import Show function comes in handy.\r\n\r\nFor Import Show to work, you need to map fixtures from your imported\r\nfile to fixtures in the current show so that Titan knows where to import\r\nthe programming to.\r\n\r\n![Fixture Mapping](/docs/images/Fixture-Mapping.png)\r\n\r\nYou can then select items from the imported show and store them onto\r\nworkspace or panel buttons in your current show.\r\n\r\n![Import](/docs/images/Import.png)\r\n\r\n1. Press the \\<Disk\\> button.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Import Show\\] (The plus button at the top right of the Show\r\nLibrary window also opens this menu).\r\n\r\n3. The Show Browser window opens. Select the show you want to import\r\nfrom and press \\[Load Show\\].\r\n\r\n4. The Show Library window will now open. Your current show and the\r\nimported show will appear as buttons at the top of the show browser. You\r\ncan import items from more than one show at once by repeating steps 1-3.\r\n\r\n5. Click on the Mapper tab, and select your imported show.\r\n\r\n6. Select a fixture in your imported show, then click the arrow beside\r\nthe fixture it maps to in the current show. To remove a mapping, click\r\nthe \\[Clear Fixture Mapping\\] context button.\\\r\nYou can select multiple target fixtures by dragging a box over the\r\nfixtures, or click on the source fixture again and map to another\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\n7. When you have mapped all fixtures you want to import data from,\r\nclick on the Show Library tab.\r\n\r\n8. Select the items you want to import (single or multiple). Use the\r\nbuttons on the left to select Palettes, Groups etc.\r\n\r\n9. Select handle(s) where you want to store the imported items.\r\n\r\n10. When you have imported all the items you want, press \\<Exit\\>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n-   You can filter fixture types to make the mapping easier using the\r\n    buttons on the left and right sides of the show browser.\r\n\r\n-   You can directly import shows without using the Disk menu by\r\n    clicking the Plus button at the top right of the Show Browser.\r\n\r\n-   You can find more information about the Show Library [here](./show-library.md).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAutosave\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe console will automatically save your show to its internal hard disk\r\nwhen you shut it down. It will also autosave the show every 30 minutes\r\nin case the console loses power.\r\n\r\nYou can disable Autosave or alter the time between saves using option\r\n\\[Auto Save\\] on the Disk menu (press the \\<Disk\\> button). You can\r\nreload Autosave files using the Show Browser.\r\n\r\n>This option is included because Autosave used to make the console pause, however this is no longer the case and we recommend that you do not disable Autosave. If you lose power while programming Autosave will make your day a whole lot better.\r\n\r\nRecover show\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIf Titan shuts down improperly due to a crash or power failure, and when\r\nyou restart it the most recent showfile can't be reloaded, a softkey\r\noption \\[Recover Show\\] will be displayed which will attempt to load the\r\nshow from the temporary directory. You will also see options to start a\r\nnew show or load a previous show.\r\n\r\nBacking up existing show files to USB pen drive\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you just want to save a copy of your current show, you can use the\r\nnormal save function to save it to the USB drive instead of the hard\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\nTo copy an existing show file on the hard disk to a USB drive, first\r\nensure your current show is saved, then use the Disk functions to load\r\nthe existing show from hard disk, then save it to the USB drive.\r\nAlternatively you can use the Folders command on the Tools menu.\r\n",

To create a new user, press \\[Add a User\\], enter a name for the new\r\nuser and press \\[OK\\].\r\n\r\n5. You can also quickly change user from the root menu by holding\r\n\\<Avo\\> shift and pressing \\[User ... \\]\r\n\r\n-   If multiple consoles are connected in a collaborative session, any\r\n    user added to one of the consoles will be available on any of the\r\n    other consoles.\r\n\r\nHandle Worlds\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nEach show can have multiple Handle Worlds, each having its own layout of\r\nhandles. This allows each user to have their own layout of cues,\r\npalettes and chases which can be easily switched, for example when a\r\nsupport band and headline band are using the same console, or when\r\nmultiple programmers are working collaboratively on a number of\r\nconsoles.\r\n\r\nWhen a new user is selected, the handle world they were using is also\r\nloaded.\r\n\r\nAll handle worlds are stored within the showfile, the default handle\r\nworld is called \"Mapping World 1\".\r\n\r\nHandle Worlds are managed from the Disk menu.\r\n\r\n1. Press the \\<Disk\\> button.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[Handle Worlds\\].\r\n\r\n3. To switch to a different handle world, press \\[Select Handle World\\]\r\nand select a new handle world from the list (the current one is\r\nhighlighted).\r\n\r\n4. To create a new handle world, press \\[Add Handle World\\], enter a\r\nname for the new world and press \\[OK\\].\r\n\r\n5. \\[Delete Handle World\\] will delete the world, any handles used only\r\nin that world will become unassigned (and can be retrieved using the\r\nShow Library if needed).\r\n\r\n-   Items created in a different handle world can be accessed using the\r\n    Show Library workspace and assigned to handles in the current handle\r\n    world.\r\n\r\n-   The \\[Follow World Page Change\\] option sets whether the handle page\r\n    will change if a user using the same handle world on another console\r\n    changes the page.\r\n\r\nLinking to other TitanNet sessions\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf multiple Titan consoles are connected in the same network you can\r\nchoose to connect them as multi-user, [backup](../running-the-show/linking-consoles-for-multi-user-or-backup.md#setting-up-consoles-for-backup), or both. This is also how\r\nyou connect TitanNet processors to expand DMX outputs.\r\n\r\n> All consoles to be linked must be running the same version of Titan for this to work.\r\n\r\nFor details of how to connect Titan consoles together on a network, see\r\n[Networking the Console](../networking.md).\r\n\r\n1. Press the \\<Disk\\> button.\r\n\r\n2. Press \\[TitanNet Sessions\\].\r\n\r\n3. \\[Sessions View\\] opens a window that shows you how your console is\r\nconnected to others, and what other TitanNet sessions are available. You\r\ncan touch on another console in the window and click \\[Connect\\] to\r\nstart a connection, or use the other buttons to leave a session.\r\n\r\n4. Or select \\[Backup\\], \\[Multi-User\\] or \\[Backup & Multi-User\\] to\r\nshow a list of sessions which you can connect to. Click on the session\r\nto start the connection.\r\n\r\n![SessionsView](/docs/images/SessionsView.png)\r\n\r\nA green line shows a good connection, a dotted red line shows a\r\nproblem with a connection. Unavailable consoles are shown with a red\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nInitially all consoles are \"Master\" consoles. If you connect to a\r\nsession on another console as multi-user you become a \"Slave\" on\r\nthat console. The show on the Master is transferred across the\r\nnetwork to the Slave. On the Slave you can choose to save the show\r\nlocally or to save changes back to the Master console.\r\n\r\nThe toolbar will show details of the master/slave status. Console\r\nlegends can be changed in the System menu using the \\[Console\r\nLegend\\] option.\r\n\r\n![Shell Slave](/docs/images/Shell-Slave.png)\r\n\r\nConsoles connected in a multi-user session work on the same show. If\r\nthe same handle worlds are selected then an action on one console is\r\nmirrored across them all, for example firing a cue on the slave\r\nconsole will also fire the cue on the master. If the master has\r\nmotorised faders, the fader will move; if not, fader levels must\r\nmatch before they can take over. If different handle worlds are\r\nselected, users can work independently on their own pool of handles.\r\n\r\nIn all situations the master console outputs DMX and channels in a\r\nremote programmer are shown with a blue dot on the touch wheel\r\nviews. If two or more consoles are editing the same fixture, the\r\nlast console to change any attribute will take over control of the\r\nfixture.\r\n\r\nSlaves can leave a session using the \\[Leave Session\\] button in the\r\nSessions View or in the TitanNet menu. The console will restore the\r\nlocal show it had loaded prior to joining. Master consoles have the\r\noption to \\[Terminate Session\\].\r\n\r\nIf a console is running as [backup](../running-the-show/linking-consoles-for-multi-user-or-backup.md#setting-up-consoles-for-backup), it has options to \\[Takeover\\],\r\n\\[Sync now\\] and \\[Leave Session\\]. If \\[Takeover\\] is selected, the\r\nconsole will immediately become the master and take over DMX output\r\nwith the chosen user and handle worlds selected. The console which\r\nwas master will go into a dormant state with DMX disabled.\r\n\r\nConsoles must be running Titan v8 or above to join a multi-user or\r\nbackup session with another Titan v8 console.\r\n\r\n**For Titan Mobile:**\r\n\r\n> Network Discovery must be enabled in the Windows User Profile you are using or consoles will not be able to see each other on the network. Ensure the Windows option \\'Turn on network discovery\\' is selected in the Network Sharing options.\r\n",

From v12, to run the Titan Simulator an\r\nAvoKey Simulator dongle must be connected, or a T1/T2 device.\r\n\r\n\r\n> From v7, Windows XP and Vista are no longer supported by Titan software.\r\n> Your PC must be running a 64 bit version of Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.                      \r\n\r\nCapture visualiser requires a capable graphics card. If you have problems with Capture,      \r\nensure you have installed the latest drivers for your graphics card from the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nSimply download and run the Titan PC Suite installer from the Avolites\r\nwebsite. The first time you run the Editor you will need to license the\r\nsoftware to the AvoKey; follow the instructions given on screen by the\r\nAuthenticator system.\r\n\r\nOnce licensed, you have a choice of how Titan will operate:\r\n\r\n-   If you run Titan Go with an Editor/Simulator AvoKey, you will get\r\n    one universe of DMX (via Art-Net) with no spoilers. With a T1 or T2\r\n    connected you will get one or two universes of DMX via XLR and\r\n    Art-Net with no spoilers.\r\n\r\n-   If you run a simulated console, you will get full DMX output on all\r\n    universes but periodically random DMX values will be sent down all\r\n    DMX outputs as a \"spoiler\", please wait for this to stop before\r\n    continuing programming.\r\n\r\nRunning Titan Simulator\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you start Titan Simulator you need to select which console you are\r\nsimulating. The simulator will then open a Virtual Panel, which\r\nreplicates the physical controls of your chosen console, and monitor\r\nwindows for each of the monitor outputs.\r\n\r\n> The touch screen display is shown separately from the Virtual Panel. It is helpful to have two monitors to allow you to see the touch screen and the Virtual Panel at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe Virtual Panel works exactly the same as the real panel; to hold a\r\nbutton down so you can press a second button, right click it using the\r\nmouse.\r\n\r\nUsing Virtual Panel with a console\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs well as its use with the simulator, you can also run the Virtual\r\nPanel on a console. This could be handy to keep things going if you are\r\nsuffering hardware problems with the real console controls.\r\n\r\nTo show the Virtual Panel, click the Tools menu on the toolbar, then\r\nselect Other Programs, then Virtual Panel. The Virtual Panel controls\r\nwill work in parallel with the real controls.\r\n",

You can then set a fixed layout using the \\[Rows\\] and\r\n\\[Columns\\] buttons.\r\n\r\n![Rows and Columns](/docs/images/Rows-and-Columns.png)\r\n\r\nThe Rows and Columns settings are remembered even if you change the\r\nbutton size back to one of the automatic sizes, which allows you to swap\r\nbetween auto and fixed button size modes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaving workspace layouts\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nYou can save workspace layouts, allowing you to reconfigure either all the windows on one\r\nscreen, or all the windows on all the screens, at the touch of a button.\r\n\r\nWorkspace layouts are saved to the Workspaces touch buttons to the left\r\nof the A-G menu buttons and above the wheel displays (except on Sapphire Touch and Titan Go where\r\nthey are down the left side of the screen).\r\n\r\n![Workspaces](/docs/images/Recoding-a-Workspace-Layout.png)\r\n\r\nExternal screens have their own workspace buttons down the side of the screen (these\r\ncan be turned off in the User Settings / General options.)\r\n\r\nTo record, press \\<View/Open\\> then\r\n\\[Record Workspace\\], then touch one of the Workspaces buttons, or just\r\ntouch an empty button twice to Quick Record. You can also save\r\nworkspaces onto any grey handle or macro button.\r\n\r\nWhen saving and loading workspaces, it's often useful to be able to set how existing windows\r\nwill behave if you load more windows, and to be able to target particular windows to a certain screen on the console.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Record Visible/All Windows\\] lets you set whether the workspace\r\n    will contain only the windows which are currently visible, or will\r\n    also include any windows which are hidden underneath other windows.\r\n\r\n-   \\[Remove/Leave other windows on recall\\] sets whether all other\r\n    windows will be closed when this workspace is recalled. If set to remove,\r\n\tthe Workspace button will show an X in the corner.\r\n\t\r\n\t![Workspaces](/docs/images/Workspace-Layout-Button-Letters-X.png)\r\n\r\n-   \\[Screens=\\] sets whether the workspace layout will record all the screens,\r\n    or individual screens (you can select or deselect each screen).\r\n\r\n-   \\[Recall as Recorded / Where Selected\\] only appears if the Screens option\r\n    is set to record only a single screen, and sets whether the workspace will\r\n\trecall onto the screen where you recorded it (button shows S + the screen number), or if it will recall onto\r\n\tthe screen where you selected it (button shows a target symbol).\r\n\t![Workspaces](/docs/images/Workspace-Layout-Button-Letters.png)\r\n\r\n-   To delete a workspace button, press \\<View/Open\\>, \\<Delete\\>, then\r\n    the workspace button to be deleted.\r\n\r\n-\tWhen recalling a workspace, if you press \\<View/Open\\> first then softkey buttons let you\r\n\tset the workspace to recall to the particular screen where it was recorded \\[As Recorded\\], or to a different screen\r\n\t(the other screen numbers are listed on softkeys). This is useful when a workspace contains only a single screen,\r\n\tallowing you to recall it onto a different screen.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n>\tScreen numbering:  \r\n\tOn consoles with a single internal screen, that is (1) and the external screen is (2).  \r\n\tOn Arena \tthe main screen is (1), the mini screen (2) and the external screen (3).   \r\n\tOn Sapphire Touch the right main screen is (1), the left main screen is (2) and the external screens are (3) and (4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an example of setting up a workspace, suppose while programming you\r\nwanted to be able to access fixtures, position palettes, fixture\r\nattributes and shapes:\r\n\r\n1. Double press the \\<View/Open\\> button. Press \\<Exit\\> to get to the root menu then the \\[Open Workspace\r\nWindow\\] menu softkey.\r\n\r\n2. Find the \\[Fixtures\\] icon on the screen and press it.\r\n\r\n3. If the window is not in the top left quarter, press the \\<Size &\r\nPosition\\> button (above the numeric keys) until the window occupies the\r\ntop left quarter. Or press the Settings/Cog touch button on the window\r\ntop bar and press the top left position button in that window.\r\n\r\n4. Double press \\<View/Open\\>  again and select the \\[Positions\\]\r\nwindow. Press the \\<Size & Position\\> button to position it in the desired\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\n5. Repeat to activate the \\[Attribute Control\\] and \\[Shapes\\] windows.\r\n\r\n6. Press \\<View/Open\\> then \\[Record Workspace\\], or hold \\<Avo\\> and\r\npress \\<View/Open\\>. Type in a name for the workspace. Then touch the\r\nWorkspace button where you want to store this workspace layout. Or, you\r\ncan use Quick Record -- just touch an empty workspace button and it will\r\nturn red with a +. Type a name for the workspace and touch again to\r\nstore it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick record\r\n------------\r\n\r\n![Quick Record](/docs/images/Recoding-a-Workspace-Layout.png)Some windows - Groups, Workspaces,\r\nPlaybacks, and all the Palette windows - have a Quick Record function.\r\nSet up what you want to record, then touch or click an empty button\r\nonce. The button will light up red with a + sign. At this point you can\r\nenter a legend. Touch or click again to store the item.\r\n\r\nThe Quick Record function can be disabled for a particular button type using [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md).\r\n\r\nFor palette buttons, the quick record function works slightly differently to pressing \\<Record\\> followed by the button. See [Storing a Palette](../palettes/creating-palettes#storing-a-palette).\r\n\r\nLegends and picture legends\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nAll touch buttons can have legends set to remind you what they do. In\r\naddition, you can draw picture legends on the buttons. To do this,\r\nselect \\[Set Legend\\] then press \\[Picture\\]. A drawing space will open\r\non the touch screen for you to draw the legend. There is also a library\r\nof pictures to choose from including popular gobo designs.\r\n\r\nColour palettes will automatically create a picture legend showing the\r\ncolour(s) in the palette when you save it. Gobo palettes will show an\r\nimage of the standard gobo, if the fixture personality has this\r\ninformation in it.\r\n\r\n![Gobos and Beams Workspace Window](/docs/images/Gobos-and-Beams-Workspace-Window.png)\r\n\r\nButton Halo\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYou can set a custom coloured halo for fixture, group or palette\r\nbuttons. This can be really useful for identifying different types of\r\nbutton at a glance. Select the \\[Halo\\] option on the Set Legends menu.\r\n\r\n![Halo](/docs/images/Fixture-Halo.png)\r\n\r\nIf you set a [halo on fixture buttons](../patching/changing-the-patch.md#fixture-button-halo), the halo colour is also used in other windows; fixture buttons can also have an automatic halo to help identify different types of fixture, which is also used in the patch window.\r\n\r\nTrackball (Sapphire Touch only)\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe trackball on the right of the console can be used either to control\r\nthe mouse pointer on the touch screens and external monitors, or to\r\ncontrol fixtures.\r\n\r\nTo use in mouse mode, hold the \\<Assign\\> button below the trackball and\r\nclick the \\'Left\\' mouse button. The trackball will then control the\r\nmouse pointer and the ring will scroll windows up and down.\r\n\r\nTo use in console mode for controlling fixtures, press the \\<Assign\\>\r\nbutton on its own. The trackball will control pan and tilt of selected\r\nfixtures, and the ring controls fine tilt.\r\n\r\nTouch Keyboard\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAt the end of the toolbar is the keyboard popup button which will open\r\nthe touch keyboard.\r\n\r\n![Keyboard Button](/docs/images/Keyboard-Button.png)\r\n\r\nThe touch keyboard can be switched between large and small size using\r\nthe Max/Min button and you close it using the large X button in the top\r\nright hand corner. You can also move it on the screen by touching and\r\ndragging the blank area of the keyboard at the top.\r\n\r\nIf you want the keyboard to pop up automatically when text input is\r\nrequired, set the Man/Auto button to \"Auto\". This setting will stay\r\nactive until you change it back to \"Manual\".\r\n\r\nThe small version of the keyboard (pictured) does not have some of the\r\nless frequently used buttons.\r\n\r\n![Keyboard](/docs/images/Keyboard.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTrackball (Sapphire Touch only)\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe trackball on the right of the console can be used either to control\r\nthe mouse pointer on the touch screens and external monitors, or to\r\ncontrol fixtures.\r\n\r\nTo use in mouse mode, hold the \\<Assign\\> button below the trackball and\r\nclick the \\'Left\\' mouse button. The trackball will then control the\r\nmouse pointer and the ring will scroll windows up and down.\r\n\r\nTo use in console mode for controlling fixtures, press the \\<Assign\\>\r\nbutton on its own. The trackball will control pan and tilt of selected\r\nfixtures, and the ring controls fine tilt.\r\n\r\nMini Screen (Arena only)\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe \\<Display\\> button below the rotary encoders toggles through four\r\nfixed layouts for the Mini screen:\r\n\r\n- Workspace window(s) with encoder legends on the right\r\n![Arena Miniscreen](/docs/images/Arena-Miniscreen.png)\r\n\r\n- Workspace window(s) with macro button legends below\r\n![Mini Screen Macros](/docs/images/Mini-Screen-Macros.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Fixed playbacks window - in this mode the first two rows of touch\r\nbuttons are the same as the macro buttons below. This window cannot be\r\nmoved to another screen, and other windows open on the Mini screen will\r\nmove to the main screen when this layout is set.\r\n\r\n- Workspace window(s) fill the full screen, no button/encoder legends\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility windows for Pearl Expert shows\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe \"Fixtures and Playbacks\" and \"Groups and Palettes\" windows allow you\r\nto access the preset fader handles in shows which have been programmed\r\non the Pearl Expert.\r\n\r\nWhen either of these windows is opened, there is a context button option\r\nto \\[Move to workspace\\]. This will move the handles from the\r\ncompatibility window to the appropriate workspace window. You need to do\r\nthis twice, once with the \"Fixtures and playbacks\" window selected, and\r\nonce with the \"Palettes and groups\" window selected",

    "content": "---\r\nid: titan-basics\r\ntitle: Connecting up and Titan basics\r\nsidebar_label: Connecting up and Titan basics\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis section covers how to connect the console up, and the basic things\r\nyou need to know about operating Titan.\r\n\r\n> Radio transmitters may affect the operation of the console and we recommend that they are not placed on, above or behind the console. If you are wearing one it is best placed in a back pocket or behind you when attached to a belt.\r\n\r\n\r\nConnecting mains power\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nYou can safely connect the console to any voltage from 80 to 260V. If\r\nyour console is not fitted with an internal UPS (uninterruptible power\r\nsupply) we recommend that you should power the console via an external\r\nUPS (available from computer suppliers). If a UPS is not used, when the\r\nsound engineer pulls out the wrong plug and kills power to the console\r\nyou can lose data (up to the last Autosave) and the console may want to\r\ncheck its disk on startup which can cause delays. The UPS will protect\r\nyou from most power problems and give you chance to shut down the\r\nconsole normally.\r\n\r\nIf an internal UPS is fitted (Sapphire Touch, Arena, optional on other\r\nconsoles), on power loss the toolbar on the screen will turn orange and\r\ndisplay how long you\\'ve got before the console shuts down. A warning dialog\r\nwill also pop up.\r\n\r\n![UPS Toolbar](/docs/images/UPS-Toolbar.png)\r\n\r\nWhen the UPS battery runs low and the console is about to shut down, the\r\ntoolbar turns red.\r\n\r\n**Arena only:** The Network Switch inside the Arena has an independent\r\nUPS system which allows the network switch to continue to run while the\r\nconsole is power cycled. When the console is shut down the network\r\nswitch will continue to run for about 5 minutes. This is important when\r\na backup console is running the show through the network switch in the\r\nArena, as it allows the Arena to be power cycled without losing the\r\nnetwork link to the stage.\r\n\r\nStarting up and shutting down\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe console runs a Windows-based operating system internally, so you\r\nneed to make sure it is shut down properly rather than just turning off\r\nits power.\r\n\r\n**Start up** the console by pressing and releasing the Power switch on\r\nthe face or front edge of the console (lift up the wrist rest on the\r\nSapphire Touch). The console display(s) should come alive. The console\r\ntakes up to 1 min 30 seconds to start up.\r\n\r\n**Shut down** the console by pressing and releasing the Power switch\r\nagain. The console will perform a controlled shutdown. Wait until the\r\nPower light has gone off (about 30 seconds) before you disconnect power\r\nfrom the console.\r\n\r\n> If the console has a switch on the power module on the back, do not use this to turn off the console as this does not close down the software properly and you will lose any changes to your show.\r\n\r\nForced Shutdown\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nTo carry out a **Forced Shutdown** of the console, if the normal shut\r\ndown does not work, hold down the power switch for 5 seconds. You will\r\nlose any changes to your show since the last save.\r\n\r\nOn consoles with a built-in UPS, you cannot just pull out the power to\r\nshut down the console if it is not possible to shutdown the console by\r\nany of the above means. In this case having disconnected the mains power\r\nyou should press the Battery Disconnect switch on the rear panel.\r\n\r\n**Arena only:** Battery Disconnect will also shut down the internal\r\nnetwork switch so be careful if you are running a backup console via the\r\nswitch. When you shut down the Arena normally, the network switch will\r\nstay on for about 5 minutes then power off. There is no harm in leaving\r\nit to do this.\r\n\r\nConnecting up Titan Mobile and T1/T2\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDo not connect the Titan Mobile panel or the T1/T2 dongle to your PC for\r\nthe first time until you have installed the Titan PC Suite software,\r\nwhich you do simply by running the installer file. This will make sure\r\nthe drivers for the panel are installed.\r\n\r\n> From Titan v7, Windows XP and Vista are no longer supported. Your PC must be running a 64 bit version of Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.\r\n\r\nFor best usability, your PC should have a touch screen. If not you can\r\nuse the mouse to select touch buttons.\r\n\r\n**Titan Mobile:** Having installed the software, connect the USB cable\r\nfor the panel (older Titan Mobile panels have two USB connectors -- you\r\nonly need to connect port A, nearest the DC socket). If your PC asks you\r\nfor drivers, select \\'Install the Software Automatically\\'. If you have\r\nan older Titan Mobile panel without the built-in AvoKey you also need to\r\nattach an AvoKey to a free USB port.\r\n\r\nPower is normally supplied down the USB connection and the external DC\r\npower socket is not used, but if your PC has a lot of other USB devices\r\nplugged in, or in the case of some laptops, an external DC power supply\r\nmay be needed. The required power supply is: 9-12 volt 800mA DC.\r\nConnector: 2.5mm hole, outside diameter 5.5mm, length 9.5mm, wired\r\ncentre pin positive. Example Part number: DCPP2\r\n\r\nThe first time you run Titan Mobile you will need to obtain a\r\n[licence](./system-settings/recovering-reinstalling-the-console.md#software-licensing)\r\nfrom the Avolites website. The licence is keyed to the internal AvoKey\r\nin the Titan Mobile panel so you can install the software on multiple\r\ncomputers but it will only run when the Titan Mobile panel is connected.\r\n\r\n**T1/T2:** The T1/T2 USB devices give you a full lighting control system\r\nthat will output one or two universes of DMX or Artnet. The software to\r\nrun it is called Titan Go. The first time you run Titan Go you will need\r\nto obtain a licence from the Avolites website which will license the\r\nAvoKey built into the device.\r\n\r\nTitan Healthcheck\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nWhen the Titan software starts up, it runs a small utility called Titan\r\nHealthcheck which checks the file system and the installed firmware and\r\nsoftware for anything that might cause you problems. If any problems are\r\nfound, a warning screen is displayed which offers the option to fix the\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n![Healthcheck](/docs/images/Healthcheck.png)\r\n\r\nOnly run fixes if you have plenty of time as some fixes can take up to\r\nan hour to complete.\r\n\r\nConnecting DMX Lines\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe console communicates with lighting fixtures using the DMX512 system.\r\nThe console itself can output 16 universes of DMX (each 512 control\r\nchannels). If you need to output more universes, it is recommended to\r\nnetwork the console to one or more Avolites TitanNet processing nodes.\r\nThis off-loads the DMX processing, allowing the console to control up to\r\n64 universes of DMX in total. See the [DMX output section](system-settings/dmx-output-mapping.md#configuring-dmx-outputs) for more information.\r\n\r\nThe console has DMX outputs on 5-pin XLR for direct connection to\r\nfixtures and dimmers, and can send DMX over Ethernet and wireless\r\nEthernet systems to allow connection to remote DMX Ethernet nodes, media\r\nservers, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen you patch a dimmer or fixture you tell Titan which of the DMX\r\nuniverses it is on. Each universe can be configured to come out of one\r\nor more of the standard DMX outputs on the back of the console, and/or\r\nover an [Ethernet protocol](networking/controlling-fixtures-over-a-network.md).\r\n\r\nThe [Arena includes a built-in Ethernet switch](networking/connecting-the-arena-to-a-network.md) and has an optical network\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n> By default on a new show, the XLRs on the console are automatically connected to DMX lines starting at line 1, however if you are loading a show from a different model of console or the simulator, check the DMX Settings option to confirm how the DMX outputs are set up.\r\n\r\nThe 5-pin XLR sockets on the console are wired like this:\r\n\r\n  |   Pin #   | Use          |\r\n  |     ---   | ---          |\r\n  |   Pin 1   |   Earth      |\r\n  |   Pin 2   |   Data -     |\r\n  |   Pin 3   |   Data +     |\r\n  |   Pin 4   |   Not used   |\r\n  |   Pin 5   |   Not used   |\r\n\r\n\r\nEach DMX line should pass through all the fixtures to be connected on\r\nthat line one after the other and have a DMX terminator fitted at the\r\nend (120 ohm resistor between pins 2 and 3). You should not split the\r\nDMX lines using passive splitters (Y-splits) as this can corrupt the\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nConnecting a Monitor\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nYou can connect an additional monitor to the console (2 monitors on\r\nSapphire Touch). This gives you extra screen space for workspace windows\r\nwhich can be handy for showing Visualiser or additional buttons. Touch\r\nmonitors are very useful to give additional control surfaces. We advise\r\nyou use a monitor compatible with Windows Touch to avoid problems with\r\ntouchscreen drivers. Titan Mobile will also support 2 monitors if the PC\r\nyou are using has the facility.\r\n\r\nAn external monitor is disabled by default and will show a \\'disabled\\'\r\nmessage. To enable, switch to System mode (press \\<Avo\\>+\\<Disk\\>) and\r\nselect \\[Display Setup\\] then press \\[External Display Disconnected\\].\r\nThe option will change to \\[External Display Connected\\] and the display\r\nwill be enabled.\r\n\r\nIf you need to change the monitor resolution or settings, touch\r\n\\'Tools\\' at the very top of the screen and select \\'Control Panel\\',\r\nthen \\'External Monitor\\', then select the option to match the\r\nresolution of your monitor.\r\n\r\nClick [here](system-settings/external-displays.md) for more information about\r\nsetting up an external monitor.\r\n\r\nOther Connections\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nYou can connect a USB keyboard and mouse to the console. If you are\r\nusing an external non-touch monitor on a console without a built-in\r\nkeyboard/touchpad you will need a mouse to access the buttons on it, or\r\non the Sapphire Touch you can use the trackball in mouse mode.\r\n\r\nYou may need to use a small USB hub to connect additional devices if the\r\nconsole does not have enough USB sockets itself.\r\n\r\nAll consoles provide MIDI connections which can be used to trigger\r\nplaybacks or connect MIDI timecode to the console for\r\ntimecode-controlled cue lists. Except for Pearl Expert, a SMPTE input is\r\nprovided on the rear panel to allow the console to be linked to a\r\ntimecode source. MIDI cannot be used with the T1 dongle, but can be used\r\nwith T2 if you attach a USB-MIDI device.\r\n\r\nYou can connect the console to a LAN (local area network) using the RJ45\r\nnetwork socket on the rear. This allows you to operate many more\r\nuniverses of DMX using DMX network protocols, and also allows backup and\r\nmulti-user consoles to be connected to each other. The Arena has several\r\nnetwork ports and also has one or two optical fibre terminals allowing\r\ndirect fibre connection to the control network.\r\n\r\nOne or two 3-pin XLR sockets for desk lamps are provided on the rear of\r\nthe console. Suitable lamps are available from Avolites. The lamps are\r\n12 volt DC, wired from pins 1 (negative) and 2 (positive) of the XLR\r\n(not all desk lamps are wired like this and may require rewiring to\r\nwork). You can set the brightness of the desk lamps from System mode.\r\n\r\nConnecting Console Wings\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\"[Wings](./about-the-consoles/fader-wings.md)\" are additional control surfaces which can be connected to the\r\nconsole to provide more faders and buttons. They connect to the console\r\nby USB.\r\n\r\nThe Pearl Expert Touch Wing can only be used with the [Pearl Expert](about-the-consoles/pearl-expert-and-touch-wing.md)\r\nconsole and should be connected before the console is powered up.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "---\r\nid: tnp-console-mode\r\ntitle: TNP Console Mode\r\nsidebar_label: TNP Console Mode\r\n---\r\n\r\nTNP console mode allows you to use a TNP to run an unattended show, or\r\nto act as an emergency backup. You can create a show on a full console\r\nthen load it into the TNP for operation, or you can connect a console in\r\nmulti-user mode to create programming on the TNP itself.\r\n\r\nRunning Playbacks\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nUse the View command (see next section) to select Playbacks Grid mode.\r\n\r\n![Playback View on TNP](/docs/images/Playback-View-on-TNP.png)\r\n\r\nYou can then run playbacks from the standard Titan playbacks window by\r\ntouching the buttons.\r\n\r\nSetting the View\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nIn Console mode, the Home screen can be set using the View button to\r\ndisplay either Network Adapters (like in slave mode), Playbacks Grid or\r\nSession View.\r\n\r\n![TNP View Screen](/docs/images/TNP-View-Screen.png)\r\n\r\nSession view shows how the TNP unit is connected to other Titan devices\r\non the network.\r\n\r\n![TNP Sessions View Screem](/docs/images/TNP-Sessions-View-Screem.png)\r\n\r\nLocking the panel\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe selected view will also be shown when the console is locked using\r\nthe Lock button. If the playbacks screen is shown, the only action\r\navailable is to fire and kill the playbacks on the screen. Touch the\r\nShow Keypad button to display the numeric keypad for unlocking.\r\n\r\n![TNP Locked Playback View Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Locked-Playback-View-Screen.png)\r\n\r\nLoading and saving shows, and other Setup\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSetup mode allows you to load and save Titan shows. You can also change\r\nNetwork Settings, Node Settings and set Monitor mode (see Slave mode\r\nabove for details).\r\n\r\n![TNP Setup Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Setup-Screen.png)\r\n\r\nLoad show presents the standard [Titan loading screen](../titan-basics/loading-and-saving-shows.md).\r\n\r\n![TNP Setup/Load Show Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Setup-Load-Show-Screen.png)\r\n\r\nSave Show allows you to save a show which you have modified on the TNP\r\nusing a remote console.\r\n\r\n![TNP Setup/Save Show Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Setup-Save-Show-Screen.png)\r\n",

Buttons across the top allow you to configure the device. The\r\n\\<Exit\\> button always takes you back to the previous menu.\r\n\r\n![TNP Home Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Home-Screen.png)\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe setup screen allows you to configure network port settings, and node\r\nsettings for the overall device by touching \"Network Settings\" or \"Node\r\nSettings\".\r\n\r\nFor **Network Settings** you first select which Ethernet port you want\r\nto configure\r\n\r\n![TNP - Setup - Network Settings Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Setup-Network-Settings-Screen.png)\r\n\r\n![TNP - Setup - Network Settings - IP Settings Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Setup-Network-Settings-IP-Settings-Screen.png)\r\n\r\nYou can then enable or disable DHCP, set IP address and Subnet mask\r\nusing the number buttons, or set a fixed (automatically generated)\r\n2.\\*.\\*.\\* or 10.\\*.\\*.\\* IP address.\r\n\r\nTouch the \"Save Settings\" button to store your changes.\r\n\r\nFor **Node Settings** you can change the legend of the device and the\r\nline colour. This is shown on the top line of the device and on all\r\nTitanNet pages on connected devices. It helps you identify the device\r\nwhen you use the TitanNet overview on the console.\r\n\r\n![TNP - Setup - Node Settings - Node Line Colour Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Setup-Node-Settings-Node-Line-Colour-Screen.png)\r\n\r\nLocking the TNP\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe Lock screen displays a keypad and asks you to enter a lock code.\r\nWhen the device is locked, the screen shows \"Locked\" and shows a keypad\r\nto unlock.\r\n\r\n![TNP Lock Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Lock-Screen.png)\r\n\r\nTools\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCurrently there is only one option on the Tools screen, \"Monitor\". This\r\nallows you to monitor the processing load of the device. You can select\r\nto monitor either cycle time or render time.\r\n\r\n![TNP - Tools - Monitor - Cycle Time Screen](/docs/images/TNP-Tools-Monitor-Cycle-Time-Screen.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
