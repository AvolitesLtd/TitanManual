From Titan v10, the Capture visualiser is integrated into the console.
This can provide a realistic simulation of your lighting which is really
useful for pre-programming or making changes in blind mode during a
show.

This chapter also has a section on [linking the console to an external
full version of Capture](capture-visualiser/linking-the-console-to-stand-alone-capture.md).

![Capture Visualiser Workspace Window](/docs/images/Capture-Visualiser-Workspace-Window.png)

To open the visualiser, select \[Capture Visualiser\] from the [\[Open
Workspace Window\] menu](titan-basics/workspace-windows.md#shortcuts-to-open-workspace-windows).

> Always **pre-program using palettes**, because things never quite line up the same in a visualiser as they do in the real world. Using palettes means that you just need to reprogram the palettes when you get onto the real rig, rather than having to change lots of cues separately.
