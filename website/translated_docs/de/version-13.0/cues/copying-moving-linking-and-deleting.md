Copying or Moving a Cue
-----------------------

Using the \<Copy\> button you can make a **copy** of an existing cue, **move**
it to a new playback, or create a new playback which is **linked** to the
existing playback. You can **copy**, **move** or **link** multiple playbacks (which
may be cues, [chases](../chases.md) or [cue lists](../cue-lists.md)) in one operation.

Move is useful for tidying up the console. Linked cues are handy if you
want a cue to appear on more than one page for ease of operation; also
the linked cue can have different [timings](cue-timing.md) and 
[playback options](playback-options.md) from the cue it's linked to.

1. Press \<Copy\>

2. Select \[Copy\], \[Move\] or \[Link\]. Pressing \<Copy\> again will
also toggle these options. Some consoles have a \<Move\> button to get
straight into Move mode.

3. Press the **select** button of the cue you want to **copy**/**move**/**link**. You
can select a range of playbacks by holding the first button while
pressing the last in the range, or use the \<Thro\> and \<And\> buttons
to add more playbacks to the selection - hold down \<And\> to keep
adding them.

4. Press the empty select button where you want it to go.

---

-   The \<Menu Latch\> button latches the **Copy/Move/Link menu**, so you
    can keep copying, moving or linking things without having to keep
    pressing the button. The latched menu will stay active until you
    press \<Menu Latch\> to unlatch it.

-   \[Retain Layout\] or \[Bunch Up\] is used when copying a group of
    cues with empty playbacks in the group - you can either keep the
    empty playbacks, or bunch up the used playbacks together.

-   When in **Copy** mode, the option \[Copy Legends\] can be changed to \[Don't
    copy legends\] so that the copied cues are given default legends.

-   When in Move mode, \[Swap Items if Required\] will attempt to
    reposition any existing playbacks which are in the way of the move.
    This is useful when rearranging playbacks on a page which is nearly
    full.

Deleting a Cue
--------------

To delete a cue:

1. Press the \<Delete\> button

2. Press the **select** button of the cue you want to delete

3. Press the **select** button again (or press \<Enter\>) to confirm the
delete

---

-   Instead of deleting the cue you can select \[Unassign\], this will
    remove the cue from the handle but retain it for future use. Go to
    the [Show Library](../titan-basics/show-library.md) to reuse unassigned cues.

-   Press \<Menu Latch\> to keep the delete mode active. You can keep
    deleting using **steps 2 and 3** without having to keep pressing the
    \<Delete\> button. Press \<Menu Latch\> to exit latched delete mode.
