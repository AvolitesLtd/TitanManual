## General

### Chase Snap
If enabled the **Next Step** and **Prev Step** buttons will snap
to the new state. If disabled, programmed fades will be shown. This is
the same function as the Snap button which features on some consoles.

### Cue List Snap
If enabled the **Next Step** and **Prev Step** buttons will
snap to the new state. If disabled, programmed fades will be shown.

### Clear Record Mask
Sets whether the record mask is cleared back to
All Enabled when you enter the Record function, or whether it remains as
you previously set it.

### Copy Cues
Sets whether tracked values will copy when you copy a cue
from a tracked cue list.

### Run Startup Playbacks
Allows you to globally disable startup
playbacks from running. To enable Startup Playbacks you need to turn
this on and set some playbacks as Startup using Playback Options.

### System Render Rate (Hz)
Sets the output rate of DMX frames from
1-44 frames per second *(default 40)*. You can reduce this if processing
of a complex show is slowing down the console.

### Lock Screen Background
Sets a picture to be displayed when the
console is locked.

---

##Â Handles

### Grand Master Fader

Sets whether the Grand Master fader is enabled
or disabled (some consoles do not have this fader). This can be handy if
it gets broken or if you wish to disable it to avoid confusing
inexperienced operators. The default setting is *Disabled*.

### Delete Default
Sets whether items are deleted when you press Delete
and double tap them, or whether they are released from the handle and
become unassigned. Unassigned items can be reused from the Show Library.

### Prompt Replace

Sets the console action when you try to save to a
handle or playback which is already used.

\[Prompt for Merge or Replace\] - the console will always prompt\
\[Always Merge\] - the console will never prompt\
\[Palettes Always Merge\] - the console will prompt unless you are
saving a palette

### Display Halo

Allows you to turn off all coloured halos on buttons.

### Fixture Halos

Sets how coloured halos are displayed on fixture
buttons.

\[Custom\] - Only user defined halo colours are shown.\
\[Auto\] - Fixture buttons are coloured using automatic fixture colours

### Handle Buttons
Sets the default size of the touch buttons to
\[Small\], \[Normal\], \[Large\] or \[Super Size\]. 

This can be
overridden separately in any window.

### Text Size

Sets the default size of the text used in touch buttons.
Can be overridden in any window.

### Playback Paging

\[Playback paging\] sets how the playback faders
behave when you change page with a playback active.\
\[Normal\] - sets the normal mode for the console type.\
\[Always Hold\] - sets the standard behaviour for non-motorised faders
where the fader keeps control of the active playback when the page is
changed and has to be lowered to zero before a playback on the new page
can be fired.\
\[Never Hold\] - the standard behaviour for motorised faders where the
fader always relates to the current page. To regain control of a
playback from another page you have to go back to that page and level
match the fader (which is done automatically by motorised fader). 

When a
playback is active from another page the display area goes purple and
the page number is shown at the top in light blue.

### Current Handle World
Sets the handle world - read more about [Handle Worlds](../titan-basics/multi-user-operation.md#handle-worlds).

---

## Key Profiles

Allows you to select and edit key profiles using the softkeys. See [Key Profiles](key-profiles.md) for more info.

---

## Patching

### Warn Before Parking Fixtures

Sets the console action when you patch
a fixture which overwrites the DMX channels of another fixture. This
causes the overwritten fixture to be "parked".

\[Always\] - console will warn you.\
\[Never\] - console will park the fixture without warning you.

### DMX Address
Sets whether the DMX address of fixtures is shown in
the fixture touch buttons.

### Auto Groups
Sets whether the console will automatically create new
groups for fixtures when you patch.

### Preset Palettes
Sets whether preset palettes should be created when
fixtures are patched. You can also turn this on when patching using the
\[Create Preset Palettes\] softkey.\
\[Do Not Create\] -- no palettes will be created.\
\[Create On Workspaces\] -- palettes will be created in workspace
windows.\
\[Create On Presets\] -- palettes will be created on preset buttons.

---

## Times

### Tempo Units
Sets the units for displaying tempo. The options are
\[Beats per Minute\] or \[Seconds\].

### Connected View Sets
Sets the console action when you change the
speed of a connected chase.

\[Connected View Sets Temporary Chase
Speed\] means that the console will not save the modified speed, and the
next time the chase is fired it will go back to its programmed speed.\
\[Connected View Sets Chase Speed\] means that the console will modify
the saved speed of the chase.

### Preload Time
Sets a fade time for the Preload function, normally 2
seconds. This value would normally be set for quiet fixture movement.

### Times Format
Selects between *HH:MM:SS* format and Seconds format. In
*HH:MM:SS* format the console will convert any number you enter into hours
minutes and seconds.

### Compensate for Rate Grand Master
If on (default), when a tempo is
tapped on a BPM master it will not be affected by the Rate Grand Master
being set to less than 100%.

---

## Formatting

entry of levels.

fading palettes.

the values set in the last playback when Clear is pressed. If *disabled*,
LTP channels will not change when Clear is pressed.

defaults when Clear is pressed. If *disabled*, cue times set in the
programmer will remain.

### Shape Behaviour
Sets whether Key frame shapes will overlay all
other values or will work in LTP mode where later changes will override
the shape - see [Saving a key frame shape to a cue](../effects/key-frame-shapes.md#saving-a-key-frame-shape-to-a-cue).

## Wheels

### Wheel Sensitivity
The sensitivity of the encoder wheels, and the
pan/tilt threshold settings can be adjusted using this option. Wheel
sensitivity is adjusted using **Wheel A** and the current level is shown on
the display.

### Pan & Tilt Threshold
Enables or disables the pan/tilt threshold
options below.

### Pan Threshold
Sets the sensitivity of the Pan control if above
option enabled. Larger numbers make Pan work slower.

### Tilt Threshold
Sets the sensitivity of the Tilt control if above
option enabled. Larger numbers make Tilt work slower.

the wheels when the playback is fired. The options are \[Off\],

### Auto View on Connect

will open automatically when the playback is fired. The options are
\[Off\], \[Chases\], \[Lists\] and \[Chases and Lists\]. If both Auto
Connect and Auto View on Connect are set to \[Chases and Lists\] then
firing a playback will automatically connect the playback and open the
view window for the playback.

### Press and Hold Fan
\[Press and Hold Fan\] changes the Fan function
so that it only works while the Fan button is held. This avoids the
common user error of leaving Fan turned on accidentally.
