The console operating software is under constant revision by the
Avolites team. You can always download the latest version of the
software from the Avolites website: http://www.avolites.com.


> From v10 it is possible to keep the older versions of Titan installed on a console when you install a new version, which is useful for backwards compatibility if you need to load a show created in an older version. To swap between versions go to Switch Software on the Tools menu.

-   The Titan Mobile, Titan Go and Editor/Simulator software is
    installed simply by running the "PC Suite" installer program as with
    any other Windows application. Please ensure you have exited the
    Titan software before running the installer.

-   If you are upgrading the software from a version earlier than v12,
    you will have to obtain an AvoKey USB dongle from Avolites and
    license the software. See the [Software Licensing](recovering-reinstalling-the-console.md#software-licensing) section for details of how to do
    this.
