![Sapphire Touch](/docs/images/Sapphire-Touch.png)The Sapphire Touch has four main control
areas:

\(A\) The two **Touch screens** contain fixture, palette and group select
buttons. They also show legends for the playback faders and shows the
current menu page and softkey buttons on the top right of the right hand
screen.

\(B\) The **Playback faders** select and control cues and programs

\(C\) The **Preset playbacks** are used for patching fixtures or for
additional playbacks.

\(D\) The **Programming and setup controls** configure and program the console,
within which the **macro/executor buttons** allow storage of frequent key
sequences, screen layouts, groups or programs.

## The Main Controls

![Sapphire Front](/docs/images/Sapphire-Front.png)

\(E\) The **Workspace windows** on the touch screens contain touch buttons for
fixtures, palettes, groups, playbacks, macros and more. You can also set
fixture attributes and show information windows.

\(F\) The **System display** area of the touch screen is the nerve centre of
the console and shows you what is going on. This part of the display
shows various screens of information depending on what you are currently
doing.

\(G\) The **Menu Softkeys** (labelled A - G) are used to select control
options. The options for each key change depending on what the console
is doing. Softkey commands are shown in the manual 
like this: \[Edit Times\]

\(H\) The **Preset Faders** at the top are used to patch fixtures, and store
and play back cues or chases. (I) **The Preset Page Select buttons** in the
centre of the faders let you change to a different page.

\(J\) The **Macro Buttons** store frequently used sequences of keypresses
which can be replayed with a single button press. Playbacks can also be
stored here. The display immediately above the buttons shows legends for
the buttons.

\(K\) The **Playback faders** are used to store and play back cues or chases.
\(L\) The **Playback Page Select buttons** let you change to a different page
of playbacks. The touch screen above the faders shows information about
each playback.

\(M\) The **Control wheels** are used to set control values (attributes) for
the fixtures, and to set chase speeds and fades. The touch screen above
the wheels shows information about the attributes being controlled.

\(N\) The **trackball** controls pan and tilt of fixtures, and can also be
used to control the mouse pointer for the screens.

\(O\) The **Numeric keypad** and other control buttons are used to enter
values and change controls on the console.

\(P\) The **Function buttons** are used to carry out functions such as storing
cues, copying, patching, saving to disk, etc.

\(Q\) The **Attribute select buttons** are used to select which attributes of
a fixture (e.g. colour, gobo, pan, focus) are going to be controlled
using the Control wheels. The buttons have lights on to show you which
attributes are active. The Red button just below allows you to locate
fixtures, which sets them to a known start position while programming.

storage tray. On the left hand end \(R\) is a USB socket for saving shows and
power/disk indicator lights. Near the right hand side \(S\) is the power
switch.
