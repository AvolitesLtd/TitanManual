Mostly you don't have to do anything special with Capture once you have
it set up. Just operate the console as normal and Capture will show you
what would be happening on the stage.

>If you use the visualiser a lot, it's very handy to have an external monitor to show it on. Otherwise you constantly have to switch between the workspace windows and the visualiser window.

Fixture Selection
-----------------

If you [select fixtures](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#selecting-fixtures-and-dimmers-for-control) on the console, the fixtures will highlight in
Capture so you can see where they are in real life.

Camera Views
------------

Capture lets you can see how the lighting will look from any seat in the
house. Even if you're in the venue with the full rig in front of you
this means you can see the look without having to run all over the
venue.

Set up multiple cameras as described in [the previous section](setting-up-the-rig.md#setting-up-cameras-views) and you can
either click between them or show the 4 standard camera views as a quad
split.
