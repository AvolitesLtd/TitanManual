You can connect multiple consoles together to work together on a show.
You can also have multiple user setups on a show on a single console to
allow different layouts, for example for a support band LD.

Users
-----

Each show can have multiple users. Each user has their own user
settings, key profiles and handle layout (known as a *handle world*).
This provides a quick way to switch between preferred user settings and
handle layouts, for example at a festival or other event where there are
a number of operators.

Users are stored in the showfile and the currently selected user is
restored when loading a show. The default user is called "Operator" and
the prompt area in the display shows the current user name and selected
key profile.

To change or create users, go to the Users menu.

1. Press the \<Disk\> button.

2. Press \[Users\].

3. To switch to a different user, press \[Change Current User\] and
select a new user from the list (the current user is highlighted).

4. To create a new user, press \[Add a User\], enter a name for the new
user and press \[OK\].

5. You can also quickly change user from the root menu by holding
\<Avo\> and pressing \[User ... \]

-   If multiple consoles are connected in a collaborative session, any
    user added to one of the consoles will be available on any of the
    other consoles.

Handle Worlds
-------------

Each show can have multiple Handle Worlds, each having its own layout of
handles. This allows each user to have their own layout of cues,
palettes and chases which can be easily switched, for example when a
support band and headline band are using the same console, or when
multiple programmers are working collaboratively on a number of
consoles.

When a new user is selected, the handle world they were using is also
loaded.

All handle worlds are stored within the showfile, the default handle
world is called "Mapping World 1".

Handle Worlds are managed from the Disk menu.

1. Press the \<Disk\> button.

2. Press \[Handle Worlds\].

3. To switch to a different handle world, press \[Select Handle World\]
and select a new handle world from the list (the current one is
highlighted).

4. To create a new handle world, press \[Add Handle World\], enter a
name for the new world and press \[OK\].

5. \[Delete Handle World\] will delete the world, any handles used only
in that world will become unassigned (and can be retrieved using the
Show Library if needed).

-   Items created in a different handle world can be accessed using the
    Show Library workspace and assigned to handles in the current handle
    world.

-   The \[Follow World Page Change\] option sets whether the handle page
    will change if a user using the same handle world on another console
    changes the page.

Linking to other TitanNet Sessions
----------------------------------

If multiple Titan consoles are connected in the same network you can
choose to connect them as multi-user, 
[backup](../running-the-show/linking-consoles-for-multi-user-or-backup.md#setting-up-consoles-for-backup),
or both. 

> All consoles to be linked must be running the same version of Titan
for networking to work correctly.

For details of how to connect Titan consoles together on a network, see
[Networking the Console](../networking.md).

1. Press the \<Disk\> button.

2. Press \[TitanNet Sessions\].

3. \[Sessions View\] opens a window that shows you how your console is
connected to others, and what other TitanNet sessions are available. You
can touch on another console in the window and click \[Connect\] to
start a connection, or use the other buttons to leave a session.

4. Or select \[Backup\], \[Multi-User\] or \[Backup & Multi-User\] to
show a list of sessions which you can connect to. Click on the session
to start the connection.

![SessionsView](/docs/images/SessionsView.png)

A green line shows a good connection, a dotted red line shows a
problem with a connection. Unavailable consoles are shown with a red
background.

Initially all consoles are "Master" consoles. If you connect to a
session on another console as multi-user you become a "Slave" on
that console. The show on the Master is transferred across the
network to the Slave. On the Slave you can choose to save the show
locally or to save changes back to the Master console.

The toolbar will show details of the master/slave status. Console
legends can be changed in the System menu using the \[Console
Legend\] option.

![Shell Slave](/docs/images/Shell-Slave.png)

Consoles connected in a multi-user session work on the same show. If
the same handle worlds are selected then an action on one console is
mirrored across them all, for example firing a cue on the slave
console will also fire the cue on the master. If the master has
motorised faders, the fader will move; if not, fader levels must
match before they can take over. If different handle worlds are
selected, users can work independently on their own pool of handles.

> All consoles in a session using the same user & handle world will
  share the same connected handle. If this is not the desired
  behaviour, then  the other consoles in the session will require
  their own user/handle world.

In all situations the master console outputs DMX and channels in a
remote programmer are shown with a blue dot on the touch wheel
views. If two or more consoles are editing the same fixture, the
last console to change any attribute will take over control of the
fixture.

Slaves can leave a session using the \[Leave Session\] button in the
**Sessions View** or in the **TitanNet menu**. The console will restore the
local show it had loaded prior to joining. Master consoles have the
option to \[Terminate Session\].

If a console is running as
[backup](../running-the-show/linking-consoles-for-multi-user-or-backup.md#setting-up-consoles-for-backup),
it has options to \[Takeover\],
\[Sync now\] and \[Leave Session\]. If \[Takeover\] is selected, the
console will immediately become the master and take over DMX output
with the chosen user and handle worlds selected. The console which
was master will go into a dormant state with DMX disabled.

> Consoles must be running the same version of Titan to join a multi-user or
backup session.

### Titan Mobile

**Network Discovery** must be enabled in the **Windows User Profile** you
are using or consoles will not be able to see each other on the network.
Ensure the Windows option **'Turn on network discovery'** is selected in
the **Network Sharing** options.
