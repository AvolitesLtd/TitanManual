Copying a Cue
-----------------------

Using the \<Copy\> button you can make a **copy** of an existing cue, or create a 
new playback which is **linked** to the
existing playback. You can **copy** multiple playbacks (which
may be cues, [chases](../chases.md) or [cue lists](../cue-lists.md)) in one operation.

Linked cues are handy if you
want a cue to appear on more than one page for ease of operation; also
the linked cue can have different [timings](cue-timing.md) and 
playback [Options](playback-options.md) from the cue it's linked to.

1. Press \<Copy\>

2. If you want to make a linked copy, press \<Copy\> again or press the \[Link\] softkey. 

3. Press the **select** button of the cue you want to **copy**. You
can select a range of playbacks by holding the first button while
pressing the last in the range, or use the \<Thro\> and \<And\> buttons
to add more playbacks to the selection - hold down \<And\> to keep
adding them.

4. Press an empty select button where you want it to go, or if you are copying multiple
playbacks, where you want them to start.

---

-   The \<Menu Latch\> button latches the **Copy** menu, so you
    can keep copying things without having to keep
    pressing the button. The latched menu will stay active until you
    press \<Menu Latch\> to unlatch it.

-   \[Retain Layout\] or \[Bunch Up\] is used when copying a group of
    cues with empty playbacks in the group - you can either keep the
    empty playbacks, or bunch up the used playbacks together.

-   The option \[Copy Legends\] can be changed to \[Don't
    copy legends\] so that the copied cues are given default legends.

Moving a Cue
-----------------------

The \<Move\> button allows you to move one or more cues to a different playback handle. **Move** is useful for tidying 
up the console after programming to put similar cues together or move them onto different pages. 

Again you can move multiple cues by holding down the first playback button while pressing
the last in the range or using the \<Thro\> and \<And\> buttons as described above and latch
the **Move** function using the \<Menu Latch\> button. 

-   On older consoles which do not have a hardware button for Move, hold \<Avo\> while pressing \<Copy\>
	to obtain the **Move** function (as printed on the console panel).

-   When moving a block of cues, \[Swap Items if Required\] will attempt to
    reposition any existing playbacks which are in the way of the moved block.
    This is useful when rearranging playbacks on a page which is nearly
    full.


Deleting a Cue
--------------

To delete a cue:

1. Press the \<Delete\> button

2. Press the **select** button of the cue you want to delete

3. Press the **select** button again (or press \<Enter\>) to confirm the
delete

---

-   Instead of deleting the cue you can select \[Unassign\], this will
    remove the cue from the handle but retain it for future use. Go to
    the [Show Library](../titan-basics/show-library.md) to reuse unassigned cues.

-   Press \<Menu Latch\> to keep the delete mode active. You can keep
    deleting using **steps 2 and 3** without having to keep pressing the
    \<Delete\> button. Press \<Menu Latch\> to exit latched delete mode.
