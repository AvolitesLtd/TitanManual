=====================================

Copying or moving a chase
-------------------------

Chases can be copied or moved to a new playback, or you can create a
linked copy of a playback. Move is useful for tidying up the console.
Linked chases are handy if you want a chase to appear on more than one
page for ease of operation; the linked chase can have different timings
and playback options.

This operation is exactly the same as for Cues and is described in
detail in section 8.4.1 on page 210.

Deleting a chase
----------------

You can delete an entire chase by pressing \<Delete\> followed by the
Swop button of the chase to delete. Press once more to confirm.

Deleting a step from a chase
----------------------------

To delete a single step from a chase:

1\> Press \<Delete\> button.

2\> Press the Swop button of the chase.

3\> The steps in the chase are listed on the screen. Use the left hand
wheel to select the step you want to delete, or type in the number of
the step to be deleted.

4\> Press \[Delete Cue x\] to delete the step.

5\> Press \[Confirm\] to confirm the delete.

-   Alternatively you can use the Unfold function to delete a step from
    a chase.
