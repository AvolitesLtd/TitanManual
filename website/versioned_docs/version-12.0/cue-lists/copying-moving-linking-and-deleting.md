The previous section also has other methods of copying and moving
individual cues within a cue list.

Copying or moving a cue list
----------------------------

Cue lists can be copied or moved to a new playback, or you can create a
linked copy of a playback. Move is useful for tidying up the console.

This operation is exactly the same as for Cues and is described in
detail in section 8.4.1 on page 210.

Deleting a cue list
-------------------

You can delete a whole cue list by pressing \<Delete\> then the Select
button of the playback to be deleted. Confirm the deletion by pressing
the select button again, the \[Confirm\] softkey, or \<Enter\>.

Moving a cue in a cue list
--------------------------

You can move an individual cue in a cue list by selecting it in the
playback view window and changing the number using the \[Change to\]
softkey. It will then move to the right place in the list, for example
to go between cues 14 and 15 set the number to 14.5.

See section 10.3.3 on page 242 for more ways to move and copy cues,
including ways to copy cues between different cue lists.

Deleting a cue from a cue list
------------------------------

To delete a single cue from a cue list:

1. Press the \<Delete\> button.

2. Press the Swop button of the cue list.

3. The cues in the cue list are listed on the screen. Use the left hand
wheel to select the cue you want to delete, or type in the number of the
cue to be deleted.

4. Press \[Delete Cue x\] to delete the cue.

5. Press \[Confirm\] to confirm the delete.

-   Alternatively you can use the \<Unfold\> function to delete a cue
    from a cue list.


\] so that the copied cues are given default legends.

-   When in Move mode, \[Swap Items if Required\] will attempt to
    reposition any existing playbacks which are in the way of the move.
    This is useful when rearranging playbacks on a page which is nearly
    full.

Deleting a cue
--------------

To delete a cue:

1. Press the \<Delete\> button.

2. Press the select button of the cue you want to delete.

3. Press the select button again (or press \<Enter\>) to confirm the
delete.

-   Instead of deleting the cue you can select \[Unassign\], this will
    remove the cue from the handle but retain it for future use. Go to
    the Show Library to reuse unassigned cues.

-   Press \<Menu Latch\> to keep the delete mode active. You can keep
    deleting using steps 2 and 3 without having to keep pressing the
    Delete button. Press \<Menu Latch\> to leave latched delete mode.
