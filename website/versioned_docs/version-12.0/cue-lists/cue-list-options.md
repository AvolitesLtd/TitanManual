Cue list options are set from the Playback Options menu. You can enter
the playback options menu by doing the following

2. Press the select button for the cue list you wish to edit.

You can show the cue list options in a window by pressing \<View/Open\>
then the Select button of the cue list, then click the Options tab.

The Cue List options are mostly the same as for Cues and Chases, only
the additional Cue List options are described here.

Cue List options -- Playback tab
--------------------------------

Most options are described in the Cues chapter on page 217, but these
are extra options for cue lists:

**Tracking:** Enables or disables Tracking mode (where unchanged
settings persist from the previous cues). Enabled by default.

**Shape Tracking:** Sets how shapes are tracked between cues.\
Off -- Shapes will stop when the next cue starts\
On -- Shapes will track until stopped or changed in a cue\
Local -- Follows the tracking option above (default option)

**Move In Dark:** Sets the mode for the whole cue list (see section on
page 239).\
Off -- obeys settings for individual cues (default option)\
Disabled -- no move in dark even if set in cues\
Early -- moves as soon as fixture is off\
Late -- moves in the last cue before the fixture is needed

**Loop Action:** Sets what will happen at the end of the cue list\
Stop on final cue -- Cue list will stop advancing once it reaches the
last cue (default)\
Loop -- Cue list will go back to first cue after the last. If Move in
Dark is enabled, this will also loop.

Cue list options -- Handle tab
------------------------------

All these options are described in the Cues chapter.

Cue list options -- Fader tab
-----------------------------

**Fader Mode:** Sets how the cue list fader behaves.\
Fader Mode Intensity Kill With Off - the fader masters the overall HTP
level and the cue list remains active (connected) even when the fader is
lowered to zero.\
Fader Mode Intensity Kill At 0 - the fader masters the overall HTP level
and the cue list is killed when the fader is lowered to zero.\
Manual Crossfader - the fader behaves as a manual crossfade control, and
the cue list will automatically step on to the next cue when the fader
reaches the top or bottom of travel.

**Fire first cue:** Sets whether the first cue automatically fires when
the fader is raised.

Cue list options -- Effects tab
-------------------------------

All these options are described in the Cues chapter.

Cue list options -- Release tab
-------------------------------

Release Mask and Release Time are described in the Cues chapter

**Cue Release:** allows you to create an overlay cue list with gaps in
it where the fixtures will return to their previous state. For example
you could create a cue list where every alternate cue sets the fixtures
to white, with the in between cues being blank. If this option is on,
the fixtures will bump to white then return to the colour set from a
previous look.

Renumber all cues
-----------------

Allows you to renumber the cue list if the numbering has got mixed up
after lots of editing. This is only available on the softkey options,
not the touch window.

Cue Options
-----------

This option allows you to change settings for each cue in the cue list.
To select the cue number to edit, use the left hand wheel or press
softkey A then enter the cue number on the numeric keypad.

-   \[Curve\] allows you to set a different fade curve for the cue; this
    affects how the fade progresses from one cue to the other (for
    example you can select a fade which starts off slow, speeds up in
    the middle and then slows down at the end). Press \[Curve\] then
    select a new curve from the softkeys. The effect of the various
    curves is described in section 16.6 on page 328.

-   \[Link\] can be set to Wait for Go, With Previous Cue or After
    Previous Cue. See section 10.5.2 on page 247.

    section .

    cue.

-   \[Legend\] allows you to set a legend for the cue which is displayed
    on the cue list display.

-   \[Notes=\] lets you enter a note for the cue ("Leaves stage pursued
    by bear" or "wake up spot operator").

-   \[Autoload\] see next section

-   \[Cue disabled\] allows you to temporarily disable this cue, see
    section 10.3.8.
