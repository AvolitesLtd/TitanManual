So you've set up a great look on the stage, and you want to save it to
use in your show.

There are three ways of saving looks on Titan.

<strong>Cue:</strong> This is a single look. It may contain movement in the form of
shapes, and have fade in and fade out times.

<strong>Chase:</strong> This is a timed sequence of cues, often used for an
individual effect.

<strong>Cue List:</strong> This is a linked sequence of cues, usually used to store
and replay an entire show or an element of a show from a "go" button.

[Chases](chases.md) and [Cue Lists](cue-lists.md) are covered in more detail in the following
chapters.

When a Cue, Chase or Cue List is stored on a control, the control is
called a <strong>Playback</strong>. You can store in several places:

-   On any <strong>fader handle</strong> - the fader controls the intensity of
    fixtures (you can make the fader control other things using
    [Playback Options](cues/playback-options.md)).

-   On a <strong>touch button</strong> in the Playbacks window - you can set whether
    the button latches or flashes the cue using [Key Profiles](system-settings/key-profiles.md)

-   On a <strong>Macro/Executor button</strong> - again you can use [Key Profiles](system-settings/key-profiles.md) to
    set latch or flash

If you run out of faders to store playbacks, fader wings are available
for [all consoles](about-the-consoles.md) to add more faders.

Titan's cue functions are very powerful; the first part of this section
explains the basics of how the console uses cues.
