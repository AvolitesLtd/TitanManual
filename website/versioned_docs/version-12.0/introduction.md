This section is a quick guide on how to do most things on Avolites Titan
consoles. Each section has a link to take you to the appropriate manual
section for more details.

Softkeys (the A-G menu buttons next to the screen) are shown like 
<Keys.SoftKey>This</Keys.SoftKey>. Physical labelled buttons on the console are
shown like <Keys.HardKey>This</Keys.HardKey>.
