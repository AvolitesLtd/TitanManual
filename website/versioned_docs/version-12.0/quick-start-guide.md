This section is a quick guide on how to do most things on Avolites Titan consoles. Each section
has a link to take you to the appropriate manual section for more details.
Softkeys (the A-G menu buttons next to the screen) are shown in square brackets like [This].
Physical labelled buttons on the console are shown like <This>.

## Patching Fixtures
Press `Patch`, `Dimmers` or `Fixtures`.

For Fixtures, from the softkeys choose fixture manufacturer (type on keyboard to filter the list)
then fixture type, then fixture mode.

Set `DMX Line` and `Address`. Console will automatically set these if you donâ€™t change them.
Press buttons in the Fixtures window to patch the fixture, or patch fixtures on faders (except the
main playback faders) by pressing the blue select button.

To patch a number of dimmers or fixtures at once, draw a selection box over buttons on the
screen, or on physical buttons hold down first select button and press last in range. Or, set
[Quantity] in the patch menu.

To change DMX address or line, use `Repatch Fixtures`.

## View Fixture Patch

To see an overview screen of how the console is patched, press `View/Open` then `Patch`.

## Setting fixture options

Press `Patch`, `Edit Fixtures`, or use the Patch View screen.
