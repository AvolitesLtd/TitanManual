With the addition of an external Wireless Access Point, the console can
be remote controlled using **WiFi** from an [Android]((https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Avolites+Ltd)) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/avolites-ltd/id688791177#see-all/i-phone-apps) mobile device
such as a smartphone or tablet. This can be invaluable when rigging,
testing and focusing. You can also run and store playbacks and palettes
from the remote.

The remote function operates using the Avolites Remote app on the mobile
device. This can be downloaded from the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Avolites+Ltd) or [Apple App
Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/avolites-ltd/id688791177#see-all/i-phone-apps).

> Make sure you install the correct version of the app to match the
console software version, **there are different apps for each version**.

You can connect multiple remotes to the console and the console itself
remains functional while the remote is connected. Each remote has a
**separate programmer** so an operator can continue to work on the console
while another user programs other cues or palettes on the remote.
