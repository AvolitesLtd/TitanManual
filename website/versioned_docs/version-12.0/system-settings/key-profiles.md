The console allows you to reconfigure how the front panel buttons work
to suit your method of working. You can save your settings as a Key
Profile. Different profiles can be selected for different users or to
enhance the operation of the console for a particular use.

There are standard Key Profiles for Run mode, Takeover Run mode, Program
mode, Theatre mode and Nightclub mode. These standard profiles cannot be
edited, so you always know how they will behave. You can create your own
editable profiles using one of the standard profiles as a starting
point.

The current settings of the playback buttons are shown on the screen
related to each playback fader.

## Creating and editing key profiles

To create or edit a profile, switch to System mode then select \[Key
Profiles\]. You can then use the Manage Profiles menu to View, Edit,
Add, Delete or Rename profiles.

You can also create or edit key profiles in the \[Handle\] tab of
Playback Options.

Key Profiles can also be viewed from the Show Library window as
described in [Show Library](../titan-basics/show-library/#key-profiles-view) section.

When Adding a new profile, you can select an existing profile to copy
settings from.

You can also edit Key Profiles from Program mode by holding \<Avo\>,
then selecting \[Edit Current Key Profile\]. If the current key profile
is one of the non-editable system ones, you are prompted to add a new
profile or select an existing editable profile.

The current actions for the Black, Blue, Grey and Touch buttons are
shown on the left side of the screen. Once you select a key type from
the menu, the screen shows actions available for that type of button.
Only the Sapphire Touch has black buttons.

## Actions for Buttons

The groups of keys you can set are as follows. The blue or grey
fixture/palette buttons only exist on the Pearl Expert, on other
consoles these settings will not do anything.

### Fixtures
The blue, grey or touch key can be allocated to **Disabled**,
**Select**, **Flash**, **Swop**, **Latch**.

> The "Latch" function is equivalent to
putting the fader to full for that fixture and touching again returns
the fader to 0.

### Groups
The blue, grey or touch key can be allocated to **Disabled**,
**Select Group**, **Flash Fixtures**, **Timed Flash**, **Flash Master**, **Timed Flash
Master**, **Swop Fixtures**.

You can select if the group function takes
precedence over the flash function (if a handle has both group and flash
functions) or vice versa.

### Palettes

> Only effective on Pearl Expert.

The palette (grey) key can
be allocated to **Disabled** or **Select Palette**. You can select if the
palette function takes precedence over the flash function (if a handle
has both palette and flash functions) or vice versa.

### Cues

The blue or grey key can be allocated to **Disabled**, **Flash**,
**Swop**, **Latch**, **Preload**, **Go**.

### Chases

The blue or grey key can be allocated to **Disabled**, **Flash**,
**Swop**, **Latch**, **Go**, **Stop**, **Preload**, **Connect**, **Tap Tempo**.

### Cue Lists

The blue or grey key can be allocated to **Disabled**, **Flash**,
**Swop**, **Go**, **Go Back**, **Stop**, **Preload**, **Connect**, **Next Cue +**, **Next Cue -**,
**Review Live Cue**, **Cut Next Cue To Live**, **Snap Back**, **Flash and Go**, **Timed
Flash and Go**, **Release**.

### Macros
Can be set to **Select** or **Prefer Macro** (the Macro function
will take precedence over other functions stored on the button).

### Options:

Allows you to disable the quick record function (double tap
on empty handles).

### Masters

This is divided into Standard Masters and Scene Master.

For Standard Masters the options are **Disabled**, **Selection**, **Flash**, **Latch**, **Tap
Tempo**, **Nudge Up**, **Nudge Down**, **Release**, **Reset Multiplier**, **Multiplier x2**,
**Freeze**, **Connect**.

These last options are for rate and BPM masters, see
the [BPM Master Options](../playback-controls/#bpm-master-options). Freeze can be useful to temporarily pause
shapes or chases, or does a blackout if used with an intensity master.

For Scene Master the options are **Disabled**, **Exit scene mode**, **Enter scene
mode**, **Commit changes**, **Commit changes and exit scene mode**, **Enter or Exit
scene mode**, **Enter or commit scene mode**.

## Selecting a Key Profile

To quickly select a Key Profile, hold the \<Avo\> Shift button and press
\[Select Key Profile\].

## Individual Key Profiles for playbacks

Each playback can have an individual Key Profile allocated to it. This
allows you to customise the panel button functions differently for each
playback. The Key Profile for the playback is selected using the
\[Handles\] option on Playback Options. If the playback Key Profile is
set to \[Global\], the default global profile for Cue / Chase / Cue List
is used.
