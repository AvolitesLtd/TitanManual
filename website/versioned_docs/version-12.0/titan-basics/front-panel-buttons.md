The blue and grey buttons associated with fader handles, and the
macro/executor buttons are configurable and you can use them in various
ways.

Key profiles
------------

The console allows you to change the function of the blue select and
grey flash panel buttons (and the black buttons on Sapphire Touch). You
can also change the way some of the touch keys work. You can save your
settings as a Key Profile. Different profiles can be selected for
different users or to enhance the operation of the console for a
particular use. See section 16.3 on page 315 for details.

Key macro buttons
-----------------

Lighting programming can sometimes require a repeated sequence of button
presses. You can record sequences of keypresses and play them back with
a single keypress -- this is called a macro. The macro can reproduce the
timing of your button presses (Real Time mode) or just repeat the
sequence of buttons with no timing (Full Speed mode).

Real Time mode is useful when you are using a macro to reproduce a
lighting effect, for example a sequence of flash buttons. Full Speed
mode is more useful for admin tasks such as changing console mode.

Macros can be stored in the dedicated buttons on the top right of the
panel, on the grey handle buttons, and in the Macro button window which
can be shown in the workspace. The top right panel macro buttons
correspond to the first 20 macros in the window (10 on Tiger Touch).

The Arena also has two additional Macro buttons on the bottom left
corner of the console.

To record a macro:

1\> Press the \<Macro\> button (above keypad)

2\> Select \[Full Speed\] or \[Real Time\].

3\> Press \[Record\]

4\> Press a suitable empty button on the panel, or an empty button in
the Macro window on the screen. Recording starts. The Insert/Macro
button flashes during recording.

5\> Press the sequence of buttons you want to record.

6\> Press \[Record Macro\] to finish recording.

To play back the macro, just press or touch the button where you
recorded the macro. The macro will repeat all your button presses, with
correct timings if you selected Real Time mode.

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

Many features of the console can be controlled by shortcuts on the
keyboard. These are especially useful when using Titan Mobile or Titan
Simulator.

The Titan application "captures" the keyboard on start up, meaning that
if you try to use other applications at the same time they will not
receive keypresses. Pressing Break on the keyboard releases the keyboard
for other applications but disables all text entry for Titan including
the shortcut keys; changing menus will reconnect the keyboard to Titan.

Shortcuts are shown on the next page.

Locking the console
-------------------

You can place a simple lock on the console controls to prevent people
fiddling with it while you're not looking. Hold down \<Avo\> and press
\[Lock\], then type a password (numbers or letters). To unlock, enter
the password again, or restarting the console will also unlock it. After
a few seconds, the "Enter password" prompt will fade out but will appear
again if you press buttons or touch the screen. This is not a
high-security lock, it's just to prevent passing idiots messing with it.

You can set a background image for the lock screen from the Lock Screen
Background option in the General tab of User Settings (hold \<Avo\>,
press \[User Settings\]). The image can be either loaded from a picture
file or drawn using the touch screen.

If you load a picture file, the menu option \[Scaling Mode\] sets how
the picture will be scaled to fill the screen.

-   None: Image is displayed 1:1

-   Letterbox: scales the image until it fills either the width or
    height of the screen, leaving black bars on the other edges of the
    screen.

-   Fill: scales the image until it fills the whole screen, keeping the
    aspect ratio

-   Stretch: scales the image until it fills the whole screen, ignoring
    the aspect ratio

The \[Clear\] softkey will remove the image.

While the console is locked, all functions are disabled except the DMX
outputs and currently running playbacks.
