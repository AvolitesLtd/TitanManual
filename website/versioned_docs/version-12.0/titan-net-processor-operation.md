A TNP (TitanNet Processor) unit can operate either as a slave unit,
producing additional DMX lines for a console, or as a simple console for
stand-alone operation. In console mode you can prepare a show on a full
console, then load it into a TNP for operation, using power=on playbacks
(See section 8.2.10 on page 204), or you can connect an external
touchscreen to the TNP and operate it using the Titan Go interface
screen.

at the top of the screen, using the Switch Software Versions option.
