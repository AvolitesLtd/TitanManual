TNP console mode allows you to use a TNP to run an unattended show, or
to act as an emergency backup. You can create a show on a full console
then load it into the TNP for operation, or you can connect a console in
multi-user mode to create programming on the TNP itself.

Running Playbacks
-----------------

Use the View command (see next section) to select Playbacks Grid mode.

You can then run playbacks from the standard Titan playbacks window by
touching the buttons.

Setting the View
----------------

In Console mode, the Home screen can be set using the View button to
display either Network Adapters (like in slave mode), Playbacks Grid or
Session View.

Session view shows how the TNP unit is connected to other Titan devices
on the network.

Locking the panel
-----------------

The selected view will also be shown when the console is locked using
the Lock button. If the playbacks screen is shown, the only action
available is to fire and kill the playbacks on the screen. Touch the
Show Keypad button to display the numeric keypad for unlocking.

Setup mode allows you to load and save Titan shows. You can also change
Network Settings, Node Settings and set Monitor mode (see Slave mode
above for details).
