Normally the TNP screen shows the "Home screen" which displays the
connection status and IP address of the two Ethernet ports on the
device. Buttons across the top allow you to configure the device. The
\<Exit\> button always takes you back to the previous menu.

Setup
-----

The setup screen allows you to configure network port settings, and node
settings for the overall device by touching "Network Settings" or "Node
Settings".

For **Network Settings** you first select which Ethernet port you want
to configure

You can then enable or disable DHCP, set IP address and Subnet mask
using the number buttons, or set a fixed (automatically generated)
2.\*.\*.\* or 10.\*.\*.\* IP address.

Touch the "Save Settings" button to store your changes.

For **Node Settings** you can change the legend of the device and the
line colour. This is shown on the top line of the device and on all
TitanNet pages on connected devices. It helps you identify the device
when you use the TitanNet overview on the console.

Locking the TNP
---------------

The Lock screen displays a keypad and asks you to enter a lock code.
When the device is locked, the screen shows "Locked" and shows a keypad
to unlock.

Tools
-----

Currently there is only one option on the Tools screen, "Monitor". This
allows you to monitor the processing load of the device. You can select
to monitor either cycle time or render time.
