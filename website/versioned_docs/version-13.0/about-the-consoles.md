This manual is a reference guide to all the functions of Titan consoles.

We explain things in the order you're most likely to use them, so we
start with how to set up the console, then look at patching lights,
controlling lights and how to program cues.

As this manual covers all types of console, this section has details
about each individual console design in turn; where the controls are and
where the connections are.
