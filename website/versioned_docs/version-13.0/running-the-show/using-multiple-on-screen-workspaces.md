On the screen you can configure different "workspaces" which store how
the various windows are displayed. This allows you to quickly recall
different setups. Workspaces are stored and recalled from the touch
buttons to the left of the menu buttons, or may be stored to any grey
button on the console.

You can also create a Set List which will automatically recall a
workspace layout for each song.
