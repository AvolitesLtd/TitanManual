Please note that some commands may require \<Enter\> to complete the
command. In this reference \<Enter\> has always been omitted for
clarity.

\[ Softkey \] formatting means a softkey on the console.

\< Button \> formatting means a physical labelled button

{ } means a handle button, e.g. {Cue} means the blue button on a cue
playback handle

Numbers are typed on the numeric keypad

The available buttons may differ depending on which console you are
using. If your console doesn't have the button, a softkey is also
provided with the same function.

Some of the buttons in this guide have changed names and so here is a
list of the old button names and their new equivalents.
