Copying or moving a chase
-------------------------

Using the \<Copy\> and \<Move\> buttons, chases can be copied or moved to a new playback, or you can create a
linked copy of a playback. Move is useful for tidying up the console.
Linked chases are handy if you want a chase to appear on more than one
page for ease of operation; also a linked chase can have different timings
and playback options.

This operation is exactly the same as for Cues and is described in
[Copying, Moving, Linking and Deleting](../cues/copying-moving-linking-and-deleting.md).

Deleting a chase
----------------

You can delete an entire chase by pressing \<Delete\> followed by the
**Select** button of the chase to delete. Press once more to confirm.

Deleting a step from a chase
----------------------------

To delete a single step from a chase:

1. Press \<Delete\> button.

2. Press the **Select** button of the chase.

3. The steps in the chase are listed on the screen. Use **Wheel A** to select the step you
want to delete, or type in the number of the step to be deleted.

4. Press \[Delete Cue x\] to delete the step.

5. Press \[Confirm\] to confirm the delete.

> Alternatively you can use the [\<Unfold\> function](editing-a-chase.md#editing-a-chase-using-unfold) to delete a step from
    a chase.
