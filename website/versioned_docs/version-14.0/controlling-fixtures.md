When you are programming a show, and sometimes when you are running a show, you need to manually control the fixtures and dimmers to set the intensity, position, colour, etc. To do this you first select the fixtures you want to change using the select buttons, then you set the attributes of those fixtures using the Wheels and Attribute buttons.
You can also set fade/timing information for each attribute of each fixture which is treated as an additional attribute of the fixture.
