The [previous section](editing-cue-lists.md) also has other methods of [copying and moving
individual cues within a cue list](editing-cue-lists.md#moving-and-copying-cues).

Copying or Moving a Cue List
----------------------------

Cue lists can be copied or moved to a new playback, or you can create a
linked copy of a playback. Move is useful for tidying up the console.

This operation is exactly the same as for Cues and is described in
[Copying, Moving, Linking and Deleting](../cues/copying-moving-linking-and-deleting.md).

Deleting a Cue List
-------------------

You can delete a whole cue list by pressing \<Delete\> then the **Select**
button of the playback to be deleted. Confirm the deletion by pressing
the select button again, or the \[Confirm\] softkey, or \<Enter\>.

Moving a Cue in a Cue List
--------------------------

You can move an individual cue in a cue list by selecting it in the
[playback view window](editing-cue-lists.md#playback-view-window) and changing the number using the \[Change to\]
softkey. It will then move to the right place in the list, for example
to go between cues 14 and 15 set the number to 14.5.

See section [Moving and Copying Cues](editing-cue-lists.md#moving-and-copying-cues) for more ways to move and copy cues,
including ways to copy cues between different cue lists.

Deleting a Cue from a Cue List
------------------------------

To delete a single cue from a cue list:

1. Press the \<Delete\> button

2. Press the **Swop** button of the cue list

3. The cues in the cue list are listed on the screen. Use **Wheel A** to
select the cue you want to delete, or type in the number of the cue to be
deleted.

4. Press \[Delete Cue x\] to delete the cue

5. Press \[Confirm\] to confirm the delete

> Alternatively you can use the 
[\<Unfold\> function](editing-cue-lists.md#editing-a-cue-list-using-unfold)
to delete a cue from a cue list.
