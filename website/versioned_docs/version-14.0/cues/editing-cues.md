Editing a Cue by Merging
------------------------

You can edit any part of a cue you have already saved simply by making
the changes and saving the new information on top of the cue.

1. Press \<Clear\> to empty the programmer

2. Fire the cue you want to edit, so you can see what you are doing.\
*Kill all other cues to avoid confusion.*

3. Select the fixtures you want to change, and make the changes

4. Press \<Record\>

5. Press the playback **Select** button for the cue you are editing

6. Press \[Merge\] *(the cue being edited is highlighted on the screen)*

7. The console will merge the existing cue with your changes. Unchanged
information is not affected.

---

-   If you want to overwrite the cue entirely, use the option
    \[Replace\] at step 6 - but remember that unless you are in **"Record
    by Stage"** mode, any fixtures you haven't changed won't be saved.

-   To speed up editing, you can set the console to "Always Merge" the
    cue. This option is set in the
    [Handles tab](../system-settings/user-settings.md#prompt-replace) of
    [User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md) (press
    \<Avo\> and select \[User Settings\]).

-   You can also press the **Select** button for the cue a second time to
    select the **"Merge"** option (quicker than selecting the softkey \[Merge\]
    option).

Updating Stored Values and Palettes used in a Cue
-------------------------------------------------

If during a show you need to quickly update a cue, or a palette used in
a cue *(for example you fire a green cue and the fixtures turn out to be
not quite the right colour)* the \<Update\> function lets you quickly update
either the cue itself or the palettes used in the cue.

For instant update of a fired cue, change the fixture settings and press
\<Update\> twice.

1. With the cue fired, select the fixtures and change them to the
settings you want to store *(e.g. the right green colour)*

2. Press \<Update\> *(on consoles without an Update button press
\<Record Cue\>, \[Update\])*

3. Press \<Enter\> to immediately store the new values to the cue

---

Alternatively, the softkeys show a list of [palettes](../palettes.md) and playbacks which
can be updated. Select or deselect these as required.

If you have used the softkey options, press \<Enter\> to complete
the update.

---

-   You can also select which palettes will be affected by pressing the
    palette's button twice.

-   If you manually set an attribute in the cue which was set by a
    palette, then press \<Update\> \<Update\>, the palette will be
    removed from the cue. If you want to update the palette, use the
    softkey options or press the palette button.

-   If you change an attribute using a different palette, the new
    palette will be stored instead.

Playback and Cue View
---------------------

To see the current timings of the cue, touch the playbacks display for
the fader, or press \<View/Open\> then the **Select** button of the playback
you want to view. The screen will show details of the delay, fade,
overlap and curve settings for the cue. You can touch each item to
enable editing.

If a [shape or pixel map effect](../effects.md) is stored in the cue, you can view or
edit the effect by clicking the button in the appropriate column.

The **Effect Speed** column allows you to set a multiplier or divider for
the speed of effects in the cue.

The **Times** button on the left removes some of the columns, showing only
timing related information.

![Playback View for cue](/docs/images/Playback-View-for-cue.png)

### Filter Columns

You can configure which columns are shown in the Playback View using the
\[Edit Columns\] context menu button. Once you have set a view you can
save it to a filter button which appears below the Times button on the
left.

1. Press \[Edit Columns\] on the context menu.

2. Using the softkeys, enable or disable the columns to get the view
you want.

3. Press \<Record\>. An \[Add\] button will appear at the bottom of the
screen.

4. Press the \[Add\] button to create a filter button for this view.

5. You can set a legend and colour halo for the filter button using the
normal \[Set Legend\] function.

6. You can delete filter buttons by pressing \<Delete\> then the
button.

### Cue View

If you touch the View button at the right hand end of the row or the
\[View Cue\] context button, the Cue View window opens, showing you
details of the settings individual timings for all the fixtures in the
cue.

The Cue View has four different views: **Levels**, **Palettes**, **Times** & **Shapes**.
Views are selected using the context buttons to the left of the menu
buttons.

-   The **Levels** view shows the individual attribute values for each
    fixture.

-   The **Palettes** view shows which palettes have been used to record
    the cue. Palettes are shown by their legends. Where an absolute
    value was saved rather than a palette, the value is shown instead.
    Again you can edit or remove the values.

-   The **Times** view shows individual attribute timings for fixtures.
    If global timings are set, no times are shown in the cue view.

-   The **Shapes** view shows which attributes of each fixture are
    running shapes.

![Cue View](/docs/images/Cue-View-2.png)

Filter which **attributes** you are shown using the All/IPCGBES buttons in
the top left corner.

Filter which **fixtures** you are shown using the fixture type buttons on
the left.

### Edit Values in Cue View

You can **edit** or **remove** one or more individual control values in the cue:

1. Touch or drag over the required control values in the grid to select
them - *they will be highlighted in blue*

2. The softkeys then give you available settings for that control value, or
you can directly edit values by typing numeric values and pressing
\<Enter\>

3. You can turn attributes On and Off using the \<Off\> button and the
\[On\] softkey. Off temporarily removes a value from the cue, it can
later be restored using \[On\].

4. You can remove a fixture completely from the cue by selecting the
fixture then pressing the \[Remove Fixtures\] softkey.

Any changes take immediate effect.

Using Parts of Existing Cues - the Include Function
---------------------------------------------------

The Include function lets you load selected parts of a cue back into the
programmer. (Normally, only manual changes to fixtures are put in the
programmer). You can then use this to make a new cue. This is useful if
you want to make a cue which is similar to one you already have, or to
build a new cue from various parts of other cues. It's also useful when
editing shapes in cues.

There are two modes, **Quick Include** and **Advanced Include**. Quick Include
simply reloads the whole cue. Advanced Include allows you to specify
which attributes of which fixtures you want to load into the programmer.
So, for example, if you have a cue which contains position, colour and
gobo information for 8 fixtures, you can use the include function to
load only the colour information for 4 of the fixtures into the
programmer. You could then Include position information from another cue
into the programmer, and build up a new cue using information from
several existing cues.

If you Include a [chase](../chases.md) or [cue list](../cue-lists.md), the screen shows you a list of the
cues within it, and you select the one you want to Include using Wheel A
or by touching the cue. You can also type in the cue number to Include.

1. Press \<Include\>.

2. Press \[Quick Include\] or \[Advanced mode\] if you want to change
the mode.

3. Press the **Select** button of the cue you want to include into the
programmer. If you are in **Quick Include** mode, this Includes the cue and
finishes.

4. If you are in **Advanced Include**, all fixtures in the cue will be
selected. If you don't want them all, deselect the fixtures you don't
want. The fixtures in the cue are highlighted on the screen and on the
fixture buttons.

5. Use \[Set Mask\] or the Attribute Bank buttons to select which
Attributes you want to include *(all are included by default - \[Softkey C\]
turns them all off and \[Softkey D\] turns them all on)*. \[Softkey E\] lets you include
or exclude Shapes from the cue.

6. Press \<Enter\>. The selected attributes of the selected fixtures
will be loaded into the programmer.

7. **Repeat steps 2 - 6** to include other attributes from the same fixtures, or
**repeat steps 1 - 6** to include other fixtures.

>   In **Quick Include** mode, you can set a mask for the include by
    pressing one or more of the attribute bank buttons before you select
    the cue to include.

Deactivate Attributes from Cues Using "Off"
-------------------------------------------

[](https://youtu.be/p7Ffz4e4tws?t=20 "Off")

The \<Off\> button allows you to temporarily deactivate an attribute which has been
stored in a cue, as if you'd never recorded it. You can activate it again later.

For example, suppose you recorded a cue which had fixtures at a certain
position, with the colour set to green. If you later decide that you
don't want a colour recalled at all with this cue, so that the playback
will position the fixtures but leave the colour set by previous
playbacks, you can set the colour values to Off in the programmer, which
when saved will deactivate those values in the cue. You can also use the
Off function to deactivate complete fixtures in a cue.

Setting an attribute to **Off** is not the same as recording an attribute at
zero, since this would change the attribute when the cue was fired. You are
just marking this attribute as deactivated, so the attribute will remain 
unchanged when the cue is fired.

1. Press \<Off\>, then \[Off Playback Values\] followed by the **Select** button of the playback
to be changed.

2. All fixtures in the playback will automatically select. If you only
want to change some fixtures to **Off**, change the selection.

3. By default the attribute mask is set so all attributes will be
changed to Off. Press \[Set Mask\] to choose which attributes will be
set to **Off**.

4. Press the \[Off\] softkey

---

You can also use \<Include\> to set values to Off.

1. Use the **Quick Include** function (described in [previous section](#using-parts-of-existing-cues-the-include-function)) to
load the cue you want to change into the programmer.

2. Press \<Off\> to display the Off menu.

3. All fixtures in the cue will be selected. If you don't want to
change them all, deselect the fixtures you don't want.

4. Use the Attribute Bank buttons to toggle which attributes you want
to change. Then press the \[Attributes Off\] softkey to set them to Off.
The bottom softkeys also give options such as \[Dimmer Off\].

5. Press \<Record\>,  press the **Select** button of the cue, then select 
\[Replace\] to update it.

---

-   To turn off all attributes of all selected fixtures, press \<Off\>
    then \[Selected Fixtures Off\].

-   You can **merge** *"Off"* attributes into a cue without including it
    first.

-   You can also remove attributes from palettes using the **Off** function.

-   Another way to remove attributes is from the [Cue View window](#cue-view).

-   Attributes set to **Off** can be restored to their previous value using
    the **On** function. Set the attribute to **On** and **merge** it into the cue.
