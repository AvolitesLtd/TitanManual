Key frame shapes allow you to create your own shape sequences. You store
a series of attribute settings as key frames and the shape fades between
them.

Creating a Key Frame Shape
--------------------------

[](https://youtu.be/1nvLaipivhM?t=20 "Key Frame Shapes")

A key frame shape is created a bit like a [chase](../chases.md), but the shape is more
flexible because you have lots of control over the way the attribute
changes between key frames, and you can change the way it spreads across
multiple fixtures. It's also *(unlike chases)* easy to save in
[cue lists](../cue-lists/creating-a-cue-list.md#shape-tracking-in-cue-lists).

You can create the key frames either in **Channel Mode** by manually setting
up a state and pressing \[Add Frame\], or in **Quick Build** mode by
selecting [palettes](../palettes.md) or
[cues](../cues.md) which will be automatically saved as a frame
as you select them. Use the \[Record Mode\] softkey to select the mode.

In this example we'll create a colour shape, but you can create key
frame shapes for any attribute or mixture of attributes. If you create
key frames using [palettes](../palettes.md), the key frames will update if the palette is
changed.

1. At the main menu press \[Shapes and Effects\] then \[Key Frame
Shapes\]

2. Press \[Create\] to start a new shape

3. [Select fixtures](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#selecting-fixtures-and-dimmers-for-control) and set the colours for the first key frame

4. Press \[Add Frame\]. An automatic legend for the first key frame
will show above the first playback fader. *(Press \[Playbacks Display
Visible/Hidden\] to return the playback faders to normal, if you want to
select one in Quick Build mode)*.\
![Key Frame Shape - creating an effect with colour key frames](/docs/images/Key-Frame-Shape-creating-an-effect-with-colour-key-frames.png)

5. Continue to set colours and press \[Add Frame\] until you have
created all the steps you want

6. Press \[Finish Recording Frames\] when you've finished

7. Use the Effect Editor window to change the Spread, Overlap (see
below)

8. Save the shape to a cue if you want to use it in a show *(see
[Saving a Key Frame Shape to a Cue](#saving-a-key-frame-shape-to-a-cue))*

---

-   You can also use the \<Unfold\> button to switch the playbacks
    between normal mode and key frame display mode.

-   Setting the \[Frame Number\] softkey to an existing frame number
    allows you to \[Replace\] or \[Delete\] a frame. Clicking the frame
    legend or the select button of the playback will also set the
    current frame number.

-   If the shape is not visible because fixtures are not lit up, the
    locate dimmer \{Sun\} button at the bottom will light up fixtures used
    in the shape.

Changing Shape Parameters in the Effect Editor
----------------------------------------------

Once you have finished creating a key frame shape it will be shown in
the Effect Editor window.

![Effect Editor Window with colour key frame shape](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-Window-with-colour-key-frame-shape.png)

The controls at the top of the left hand pane are the global shape
properties which affect the whole shape, controlling speed, direction
(using [2D group layout](../controlling-fixtures/fixture-groups.md#fixture-order-and-fixture-layout-in-groups)),
[phase/spread](shape-generator.md#changing-the-spread-of-a-shape-across-multiple-fixtures) and
[fixture overlap](../cues/cue-timing.md#fade-times-and-fixture-overlap).

The **eye** icon in the top left corner *"collapses"* the shape preview in the
effect editor window, this allows you to expand only the shape you want
to work on if you have created multiple shapes. The **fixture icon** button
on the right allows you to change the fixtures the key frame shape shape
applies to.

The top of the main area shows a graphical version of the fades in the
shape, which you can drag around to change the timings. The yellow arrow
shows the phase offset (start position) for the layer, you can drag this
to change the start point of the shape relative to other layers *(or use
the Phase Offset slider below)*.

### Shape/Layer Controls

To start with *(or when you click on the Layer name)* the sliders to the
right of the main area are independent controls for the layer.

![Effect Editor key frame controls for layer/effect](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-key-frame-controls-for-layer-effect.png)

You can click on the buttons to the right of the sliders
to enter values from the keyboard, and when the button is clicked on the
wheels can also be used to adjust the value. A \[Reset to default
value\] softkey is also provided when you click the buttons, or
double-clicking the buttons will reset to default value.

The **Beats per Cycle** control lets you set how the programmed speed will
trigger the shape. It defaults to 1 which makes the shape run at normal
speed. Higher numbers will divide the count, for example 4 will make the
shape run at quarter of the speed - useful to synchronise different
types of shapes which are running together.\
\[Spread\] sets the beat
count to be the same as the current Spread setting for the shape. This
is useful when using dimmer shapes with movement shapes as it will make
each fixture turn on for a full cycle of the movement shape.\
\[Key Frame\] sets the beat count to match the number of key frames in the
shape.\
\[Custom\] resets the \[Value\] option to the last
entered value.
> Each key frame and each layer can have its own **Beats per
Cycle** setting.

The **Cycles** option lets you create a shape which runs for a set number of
cycles then stops. By default this is set to 0, which means the shape
will not stop. You can set this either for the whole shape, or for
individual layers - if you set it while the whole shape is selected,
then all layers will be affected, but if you set it while only one layer
is selected, then the cycles will be set for the selected layer only.
*This means you can have individual layers running continuously or for
different numbers of cycles.*

Key Frame shapes can run across **sub-fixtures** (cells). This is turned \[Off\]
by default, but you can select \[On (Group)\] which uses
the [layout set for the group](../controlling-fixtures/fixture-groups.md#fixture-order-and-fixture-layout-in-groups),
or \[On (Linear)\] which ignores the layout and just uses the cells in numerical order.

The Phase Master option lets you control the phase of the shape using
the intensity of a video layer from an Ai server. See
[Phase Control of Key Frame Shapes from Ai](../synergy/operating-synergy.md#phase-control-of-keyframe-shapes-from-ai)
for more details.

### Parameters for Individual Frames

By clicking on individual key frames on the left, you can change
parameters for each individual frame:

![Effect Editor key frame controls for individual key frame step](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-key-frame-controls-for-individual-key-frame-step.png)

-   **Timing**: use the Start Time slider or drag the step positions in the
    window

-   **Frame A Min** / **Frame B Max**: Sets how close the attribute gets to the
    programmed value. *For example if you've saved a dimmer flash at 100%
    you could make it only flash to 80%.*

-   **Mid point**: sets where the mid point of the fade is

-   **Width**: sets how much of the frame time is taken up by the fade. For
    example you could fade in 20% of the frame time then hold for the
    remaining 80%

You can change the style of the fades between steps by clicking the
curve button to the right of each step. The new curve will be shown in
the fade graphic in the main window.

![Effect Editor key frame shape changing curves for individual key frame steps](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-key-frame-shape-changing-curves-for-individual-key-frame-steps.png)

### Editing Frames

You can also edit the sequence of the key frame shape using the Effect
Editor window.

![Effect Editor key frame shape layer with colour steps](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-key-frame-shape-layer-with-colour-steps.png)

-   To **add** more frames to a key frame shape click the \{Pencil\} button to
    the right of the **layer name**.

-   To **edit** a key frame click the \{Pencil\} button to the right of the
    **frame name**.

-   To **delete** a key frame select the frame in the list then click the
    \{Rubbish Bin\} at the bottom

-   To **change the order** of the frames, select a frame then use the up
    and down arrows at the bottom.

-   To **change multiple** key frames at the same time, click on the
    multi-select button at the bottom of the window, or you can drag a
    selection box over the frames.

### Multiple Effects

Key frame shapes can have multiple layers where different effects run
simultaneously. To add another layer, click the \{+\} button at the
bottom, then select **Layers**. The new layer will appear in the list on the
left.

![Effect Editor adding an extra effect](/docs/images/Effect-Editor-adding-an-extra-effect.png)

You can also add a completely separate key frame shape or a
[pixel map effect](pixel-mapper.md).
Pixel map effects will be shown at the top of the shape list on
the left, you can use the **eye** icon to hide the pixel map effect when you
want to work on the key frame shapes.

Saving a Key Frame Shape to a Cue
---------------------------------

By default when a key frame shape is saved to a cue, the playback fader
will fade the shape. If the playback is set to have
[Speed on Fader](../cues/playback-options.md#shape-effect-speed), the
fader will master the speed of all layers in the shape.

When a key frame shape is running in a playback it can behave as Overlay
or LTP. A global value for
[Shape Behaviour](../system-settings/user-settings.md#shape-behaviour) is in the
[User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings.md), but
you can also set the mode in
playback [Options](../cues/playback-options.md#shape-behaviour) for each playback.

-   In \[Overlay\] mode (default) the shape will have control of the
    programmed attributes regardless of whatever else you do. For
    example if a key frame shape is controlling fixture colour, firing
    another playback, recalling palettes or changing colour using the
    wheels will have no visible effect. Once the shape is stopped, the
    changes you made will become visible. This means that if you want to
    you can preset what will happen when you stop the shape.

-   In \[LTP\] mode, changes of the same or higher priority will override
    the shape output. For example if your key frame shape is set to
    normal priority, firing a playback with normal priority will block
    the shape output. Killing the playback will restore the shape
    output. Quick Palettes and manual changes (the programmer) have High
    priority. Setting the shape priority to **"Very High"** would prevent
    the programmer taking over (see
    [Priority](../cues/playback-options.md#priority) in
    playback [Options](../cues/playback-options.md)).

For details of how Key Frame Shapes behave in Cue Lists, see
[Shape Tracking in Cue Lists](../cue-lists/creating-a-cue-list.md#shape-tracking-in-cue-lists).

- If you create a Mask Shape using the [Mask FX function](shape-generator.md#masking-shapes-using-mask-fx), this will also stop Key Frame Shapes.
