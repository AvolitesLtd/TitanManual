[Palettes may be saved with timing information](creating-palettes.md#creating-a-time-palette),
or you can manually override the timing when recalling the palette.

Palettes with Saved Times
-------------------------

If you have
[saved time information in a palette](creating-palettes.md#creating-a-time-palette),
the times will be used in any playback which is recorded using this palette. 
So if you programmed a 2 second fade into this palette, every playback with this 
palette will have a 2 second fade.

By default these times are **not** used when the palette is called directly, to allow 
for a fluent programming. You may however turn this on (which further enhances [busking 
with palettes](../running-the-show/playback-controls#busking-with-palettes)) using the
[key profile setting](../system-settings/key-profiles.md) for palette keys.
You can set \[Palette Is Fired With Its Times\] or \[Palette Is Fired
Ignoring Its Times\].

Manually Overriding Palette Times
---------------------------------

[](https://youtu.be/FF8szWCpVkE?t=135 "Overriding Palette Times")

Being able to recall palettes with a manual fade allows easy \"busking\"
of shows. When a palette is recalled in this way, a time is added and
the palette fades in over that time.

1. Select some fixtures

2. Type in the fade time for the palette on the numeric keypad

3. Press a palette button to recall the palette

---

-   This overrides any timing stored in the palette itself.

-   You have to re-enter the time each time you recall a palette. To use
    the same fade every time, set a Master Time: Press \<Palette\>, \[Master
    Time\], enter time. To disable \[Master Time\] set to 0.

-   Palette fading can be very useful when recalling a palette live
    during a show, as you can smoothly move fixtures to a new position
    or change colour slowly (on colour mixing fixtures).

Manual Fixture Overlap when Recalling Palettes
----------------------------------------------

You can set a [Fixture Overlap](../cues/cue-timing.md#fade-times-and-fixture-overlap)
when recalling a palette, which means that
the palette will be applied in sequence to each fixture in the group.
This is a very quick way to busk complex effects.\
**100%** means that all fixtures will change together.\
**0%** means that each fixture must complete its fade before the
next will start its fade.

- You need to also have a fade time set, otherwise Overlap has no effect.

1. Type in the overlap percentage for the palette on the numeric keypad

2. Press \[Set Overlap\]

3. Type in the fade time if fade is also required

4. Press a palette button to recall the palette

-   You have to re-enter the overlap each time you recall a palette. To
    use the same overlap every time, set a Master Overlap: Press
    \<Palette\>, \[Master Overlap\], enter overlap percentage. 
    To disable \[Master Overlap\] set to 100%.

-   Fixture Overlap always requires a fade time in order to have a visible effect.

>   When using Fixture Overlap with global palettes without fixtures selected (Quick Palette)
    bear in mind that Fixture Overlap may be performed on a large number of fixtures which
    may lead to unwanted results.

Master Time for Palettes
------------------------

Option \[Master Time\] on the Palette menu (press the \<Palette\> button
above the numeric keypad) allows you to set a default fade time. This
fade time will be used for all palettes unless you manually type in a
different time. This can be useful when "busking" a show with palettes.

The \[Master Overlap\] option similarly sets the default Overlap for
palette recall.

> You can create macro buttons to set different palette fade times. Press
\<Macro\>, \[Record\], press a button to store your macro on. Then press
\<Palette\>, \[Master Time\], \<3\> (for 3 sec), \<Exit\>, \<Macro\>.
Repeat these steps to create a Palette Snap button (0 sec), or a 1 sec
fade button, and so on.

A number of macros for various fade times (\[Palette Fade x s\]) and overlaps
(\[Palette Overlap y%\]) are available in the macro library. To open this press \<Macro\>, 
then the softkey \[View All\]. Macros from the library can be copied onto buttons
using \<Copy\> as usual.
