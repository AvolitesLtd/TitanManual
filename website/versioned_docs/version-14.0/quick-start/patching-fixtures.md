For Fixtures, from the softkeys choose fixture manufacturer (type on
keyboard to filter the list) then fixture type, then fixture mode.

Set \[DMX Line\] and \[Address\]. Console will automatically set these
if you don't change them.

fixtures on faders (except the main playback faders) by pressing the

select button and press last in range. Or, set \[Quantity\] in the patch
menu.

To change DMX address or line, use \[[Repatch Fixtures](../patching/changing-the-patch.md#fixture-exchange)\].
