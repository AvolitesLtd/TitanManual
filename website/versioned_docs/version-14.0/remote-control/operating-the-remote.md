To connect to the console, open the Titan Remote app and a list of
available consoles will be shown - hopefully if you have done the
[network setup](setting-up-the-remote.md) correctly, you will see your console listed.

There is also a local emulator which can be used to test or demonstrate
the remote when no real console is connected.

Choose what you want to control using the row of buttons across the
middle of the app. The Keypad button enables or disables the numeric pad
(the keypad overlays all the other screens, so you will need to turn it
off to see the others).

Keypad
------

The keypad screen lets you do most common tasks in the way a
programmer\'s remote normally works. You can turn on/Locate fixtures and
dimmers either individually or together.

![Titan Remote Android App with keypad](/docs/images/Titan-Remote-Android-App-with-keypad.png)

The User Number of the fixture or dimmer is used for control. For
example to turn on dimmer 3 at 50% you would press:

**`3 @ 5`**

To turn on dimmers 1-10 at 80% you would press:

**`1 Thro 10 @ 8`**

For 100% you just press @ twice, for example:

**`1 Thro 10 @ @`**

> To locate one or more fixtures, press Locate instead of the @ button.

You can select multiple ranges of dimmers or fitures using the And
button, for example:

**`1 Thro 10 And 20 Thro 30 @ 6`**.

Controlling Fixtures
--------------------

The fixture screen allows you to select fixtures exactly as you would on
the console.

![Fixture View in Titan Remote Android App](/docs/images/Fixture-View-in-Titan-Remote-Android-App.png)

You can then use the **Palette** screens to control the fixtures, or press
the **IPCGBES** buttons to directly control functions of the fixtures using
wheels.

You can scroll the fixture screen up and down by dragging the window. To
view the fixture pages, drag the Pages bar to the right.

Press the **All** button to select all fixtures. Hold down the **All** button to
step through various selection patterns (odd, even etc).

![Fixture Control in Titan Remote Android App](/docs/images/Fixture-Control-in-Titan-Remote-Android-App.png)

The wheels show function values (such as colours or gobo names). To go
to the next function, just touch the arrows at the top or bottom of the
wheel. To manually scroll the value, spin the wheel with your fingers.
If there are more than three functions, touch the **IPCGBES** button again
to change to the other functions.

Press the **Clear** button to clear the selection and all changes in the
remote programmer. Hold down the **Clear** button to clear all programmers
(for example if someone has been doing something on the console at the
same time, this will clear the console's programmer too).

You can also play back cues using the **Cue** screen. Hold down a playback
button to kill or release an active playback.

> If you update the legends of palettes or cues on the console while the remote is running, the legends on the remote will not be updated. \<Exit\> and restart the remote app to show legend changes made on the console.

Recording groups and palettes
-----------------------------

You can record groups and palettes using the **Rec** button on the remote,
then click a workspace button as normal. You can also hold down an empty
button to quick record a group or palette.

If you hold down a used palette button, the current programmer will be
quick merged into the existing palette.

*You cannot record cues using the remote.*
