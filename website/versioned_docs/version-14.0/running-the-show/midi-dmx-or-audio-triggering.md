You can set up the console to allow most features to be triggered by
external events. This is very useful in complex shows or when using in
an automated setup.

The following types of trigger are available:

-	Audio (not on all console hardware)
-	DMX
-	GPIO (not on all console hardware)
-  	MIDI (except T1)
-	Streaming ACN

> Audio trigger (sound to light) requires special hardware which is not fitted on Sapphire Touch,
Tiger Touch, Titan Mobile, T1 and Pearl Expert. You can plug a T2 into these consoles to provide
audio triggering. The motherboard "line in" socket can't be used for audio trigger.\
GPIO trigger is available on Arena, Tiger Touch II and Sapphire Touch.

Connecting External Trigger Sources
---------------------------------

Audio input is connected to the dedicated audio in jack (not the line in
jack on the motherboard) -- see information box above for consoles which provide this.

DMX inputs are connected to one of the DMX output connectors using a DMX
male to male gender changer cable. (This is a simple plug to plug cable
with all pins wired straight through, i.e. 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3).  

GPIO uses a contact closure for trigger which is connected using a dedicated jack socket, 
currently only on the Arena, Tiger Touch II and Sapphire Touch consoles.
The TNP can optionally have a GPIO input fitted, contact Avolites.

Most console hardware has a standard 5-pin MIDI connector, 
also USB-MIDI devices supporting the DirectX MIDI driver may be
used on all consoles except T1. For the T2 this allows you to
connect a MIDI fader controller to give you real playback faders.

sACN is connected using the normal Ethernet connection on the console.


-	You can link a networked PioneerDJ system to Titan to automate BPM masters; this is described 
	[in the next section](./linking-pioneerdj-system-to-titan.md). This replaces the old “Pro DJ Tap” function.

Setting up External Triggering
----------------------------

Go to the **System** menu (\<Avo\> + \<Disk\>) and select \[Triggers\]. The Triggers window will
open.

![Triggers Window](/docs/images/Triggers-Window.png)

The left hand side of the window has a list of trigger Mappings, where each mapping
can contain one or more trigger setups. A default
set is provided for MIDI Show Control which includes standard show control 
messages (see next section for details).

Each trigger mapping can be enabled or disabled using the "power" button
at the left hand end of the mapping name. This allows you to configure the
console to react in different ways and easily swap between them.

This is how you set up a trigger:

1.  Add a new mapping using the \{+\} button at the bottom of the *left hand*
    column, and enter a name for it.

2.  Add a trigger to the mapping using the \{+\} button in the *right hand*
    column or softkey \[Add trigger\].

3.  Select \[Trigger Type\] as \[Hardware\] or \[Item\].
    -   **Hardware** triggers a physical or touch button, or fader move, and
        will use the key profile set for the button/fader, just as if the user 
		pressed the button or moved the fader.
    -   **Item** triggers a programmed item, such as a cue or chase, but you can 
        select what action happens to it when it is triggered.

4.  Press the button or move the fader to be triggered, or containing the item to be triggered. 
    The status area of the screen will update to show you what has been triggered. 
	For Item triggers you can select what action the trigger will cause, using the \[Action\] softkey:
	-	Set Level (sets playback level to trigger level - but see Level Match below)
	-	Fire At Level (like Set Level but ignores Level Match and will "kill at 0" if used with a cue list)
	-	Re-Fire at Level (any level change will re-fire the LTP values in the playback - see below)
	-	Flash (like pressing Flash button)
	-	Swop (like pressing Swop button)
	-	Preload (fires only the LTP values in playback)
	-	Latch (latches the playback on)
	
	The \[Level Match\] option sets what happens if the playback has already been 
	fired by the user when the trigger happens.	If set to **On** then the trigger 
	must match the current playback level before it will take effect. If **Off** 
	(default) the trigger will override the playback at any level.

5. Press \[OK\]. You have now set up the console action which is to be
triggered.

6. Now you need to set up the external stimulus which will cause the
trigger. Select \[Trigger Type\] as Audio, DMX, GPIO, MIDI or Streaming ACN. 

7.	By default the \[Learn\] option is set to On, so you can generate the stimulus from your device (for example play the MIDI
	note, or turn on the DMX channel) and the console will automatically detect it and set the correct values. 

	Or you can enter the trigger details using the softkey options.
	-	For Audio, set the \[Band\] (frequency band) for the trigger (see [Audio Control](./midi-dmx-or-audio-triggering.md#audio-control-sound-to-light))
	-	For DMX, press \[DMX Port\] to select which DMX port you are using for DMX input. As soon as a DMX port
		is used for triggering it is switched to Rx (Receive) mode. Set the DMX address to act 
		as trigger using the \[Address\] button.\
		If you want to use it as output	(Tx mode) again you need to re-assign it 
		in [DMX settings](../system-settings/dmx-output-mapping). 
	-	For GPIO, you can \[Invert\] the trigger (to trigger on contact open rather than close).
		The Pin option allows multiple GPIO inputs but currently no consoles support this, so it should be set to 1.
	-	For MIDI, set the MIDI channel, MIDI Command, Value, and Level (velocity) ranges
	-	For sACN, select the \[Universe\] and \[Address\] for the trigger.

8. Press \[Add\] to add the trigger to the list.

9. The window will show the trigger stimulus and the action to be
carried out.

You can continue to add other triggers to the mapping.

![Triggers Window with MIDI triggers](/docs/images/Triggers-Window-with-MIDI-triggers.png)

-	To delete a trigger from the mapping, select it in the list and press
	the \{Rubbish Bin\} button at the *bottom of the right hand column*.

-	To delete a complete mapping, select it and press the \{Rubbish Bin\} button
	at the *bottom of the left hand column*.
	
-	The **Re-Fire At Level** action will cause the playback to be re-fired when the trigger level changes, so
	any LTP values in the playback will be set again. So for example if the playback sets
	fixtures to red, but then another playback changes the colour to white, the Re-Fire action would set
	the fixtures back to red when the trigger level changes, but the Set Level / Fire At Level actions would leave them
	at white and just change the intensity.
	

### Setting up a MIDI fader controller with T2

This is how to set up a MIDI fader controller to act as playback faders
on T2. Ensure your MIDI device is connected and recognised by Windows
(you can use a utility such as Midi-OX to test it).

1. From the **System** menu select \[Triggers\].

2. Add a new mapping using the \{+\} button at the bottom of the left hand
column, and call it "T2 playbacks".

3. Add a trigger to the mapping using the \{+\} button in the right hand
column or softkey \[Add trigger\] -- by default this is set to the
correct Trigger Type of \[Hardware\].

4. Move playback fader 1 on Titan Go.

5. Click \[OK\]

6. Move the first fader on your MIDI controller. Titan Go should
recognise the MIDI commands and display the trigger in the prompt area.

7. Click \[Add\]. The trigger for playback 1 is added to the list on
the right.

8. Repeat from **step 3** to add the other 9 playback faders.

MIDI Show Control
-----------------

The following MIDI Show Control messages are supported:

  Command   | Action
  --------- | ---------------------------------------
  GO        | Fire the specified playback or cue
  STOP      | Pause the specified playback or cue
  RESUME    | Un-pause the specified playback or cue
  LOAD      | Set the playback level to full
  ALL OFF   | Release all playbacks
  RESET     | Same as ALL OFF
  GO OFF    | Same as resume

Playbacks/Cues are identified by their User Number. To set the user
number, press \[Set Legend\] then the select button of the cue, then
\[User Number\].

MIDI show control devices are identified by a device ID. To set Titan's
device ID select \[User Settings\] from the **System** menu, then go to the
\[Timecode\] tab. The default setting is 0.

Audio Control (Sound to Light)
------------------------------

On supported consoles the audio input is divided into frequency bands
which can be used to provide the trigger. The \[Band\] option selects
which of the bands is being used.

  Band	| Sound frequency
  ------|---------------------------
	1	| 50Hz
	2	| 140Hz
	3	| 380Hz
	4	| 875Hz
	5	| 2400Hz
	6	| 6200Hz
	7	| 14000Hz

Audio triggers are adjusted in the Audio Triggers workspace which also
shows the levels in the different bands of incoming audio.

![Audio Window](/docs/images/Audio-Window.png)

If the console does not have suitable hardware a warning message is
displayed (see [top of page](./midi-dmx-or-audio-triggering.md#) for list of 
audio-enabled consoles).

-   The Enable switch below the gain slider disables all audio triggers

-   The left hand gain slider sets the overall input gain, which can be
    used to boost weak signals

-   Auto gain will automatically adjust the gain, this disables the
    slider from manual changes

-   The Enable switches below each band disable triggers on that
    particular band

-   Trigger level sets the threshold for triggering on each band. The
    band shows red when triggered.

-   The Auto switches on the bands automatically adjust the trigger
    level on each band when no triggers are occurring.

You can quickly allocate a playback to a trigger by clicking the top
Band button above the trigger, then select the playback to be triggered.

On the Arena and Quartz consoles, the Audio LED (just above the power switch) will
flash when audio is received. Note that the headphone socket on these
consoles is linked to the motherboard audio output and can't be used for
monitoring the audio trigger input.
