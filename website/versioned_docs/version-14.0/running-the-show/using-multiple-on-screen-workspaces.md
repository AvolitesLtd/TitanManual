You can configure different **Workspaces** which store the layout of
the various windows displayed on the console screen(s). This allows you to quickly recall
different setups. Workspaces are stored and recalled from the touch
buttons to the left of the menu buttons (or down the left side of the screen
for Sapphire Touch, Titan Go, and on external screens). You can also store workspaces
to any executor button on the console.

Double press \<View/Open\> to show the window select buttons. See
[Opening and positioning workspace windows](../titan-basics/workspace-windows.md#opening-and-positioning-workspace-windows)
for more details about using Workspace Windows.

You can also create a [Set List](../running-the-show/set-list-window.md) which will automatically recall a
workspace layout for each song.

View menu
---------

Pressing \<View/Open\> takes you into the View menu. From here you can
set up what is shown on the screen(s).

-   \[Window Options\] allows you to reposition and resize windows.

-   \[Open Workspace Window\] also gives a list on the softkeys of all the
    possible windows, allowing you to open the one you need.
