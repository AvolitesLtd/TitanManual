From v12, Titan includes Avolites Synergy software which allows you full
control over one or more networked Ai media servers. Not only can you
control playback of media and effects, but also upload new media to the
server with automatic transcoding, create new screen fixtures and new
layers on them, and preview multiple media streams in the Titan
workspaces.

For shows which include video content, this gives you a much smoother
workflow when creating and running the show.

> Ai refers to media outputs as "Screen Fixtures". To avoid confusion with Titan fixtures, Titan doesn't use "Fixture" and refers to them as **"Screens"** (and in some places **"Surfaces"**).
