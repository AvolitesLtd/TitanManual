Connecting up
-------------

The Ai server(s) need to be connected by Ethernet to the Titan console.
[Media previews](operating-synergy.md#media-viewer) use NDI streams which along with copying of large media
files can place a heavy demand on the network, so you should follow
these tips for setting up a suitable network:

-   Use at least gigabit network equipment

-   Have a dedicated network for Synergy if possible

-   If you are using Titan Mobile, make sure Windows Firewall is turned
    off

> The Ai server(s) must have the correct version of Synergy installed  to match your Titan version. To upgrade Synergy on the Ai server, download the Synergy Upgrade Installer from the 
[Avolites Download page](https://www.avolites.com/software/latest-version) and run it on the Ai server. You don't need to do anything extra on the console as the Titan installer will automatically install the latest version of Synergy on the console. 

If you have problems getting Titan and Ai to recognise each other, make
sure they are on matching software versions, and both in the same IP
address subnet range such as `2.0.0.1` and `2.0.0.2` - read more about [Networking the Console](../networking.md).


Setting up the Ai Show
----------------------

A simple Ai system involving a single screen or projector can be set up
by following the [Synergy setup](#synergy-setup) instructions in the next section. You
just need to open a blank show in Ai and you can add Screens and Layers
from the Titan console.

For more complicated requirements, create suitable screen fixtures in
the Ai show - see the Ai manual for more details on how to do this. You
can create and rename Layers from the Titan console. The screen fixtures
you have created in Ai will then become available as Surfaces in Titan.

Synergy Setup
-------------

In Titan, open the **Synergy Settings** window using the Workspace button
provided on new shows, or use the option in the Open Workspace Window
menu.

This window is a little like the [DMX settings screen](../system-settings/the-system-menu.md#dmx-settings): it lets you set up
how the Titan console is linked to the various outputs on the Ai
server(s). Also, it lets you add or remove layers from each Ai surface
and add complete new surfaces to the Ai server (though you may need to
configure these further on the Ai server itself).

![Synergy Settings Window](/docs/images/Synergy-Settings-Window.png)

On the left of the window the available Ai
servers are shown. In the centre of the window, the Surfaces and Layers
configured in Titan are shown. Connection lines show how the Titan
Surfaces will control the different outputs of the Ai server. At the
bottom are Surfaces which are already configured on Ai but are not yet
linked to Titan, these are called unmatched surfaces.

Click on the \{+\} at the bottom and select Surface from the pop up to add a
new surface. This will appear at the top; by default it has two layers
but you can change this later.

![Synergy Settings Window screen settings](/docs/images/Synergy-Settings-Window-screen-settings.png)

Clicking on the top part of a Surface will
show options on the right for the surface. These options allow you to
set the canvas resolution which can either be picked from a list of
common resolutions, or entered numerically; at the top right the display
halo colour of the surface can be set, and the \{Pencil\} button allows you
to change the name (you can also do this with the \[Set Legend\]
button).

Clicking on a Layer within a Surface shows layer options on the right.
This allows you to allocate a Rate or BPM master to the layer for speed
control.

When no Surfaces or Layers are selected, the right side of the window
shows general information about the system. There is a switchable option
"Automatic NDI Previews" to enable or disable NDI streams - if you are
using the media preview window, you will need to turn this on. If not
leave it turned off, as it causes a lot of network traffic.

Once you have created a surface in Titan, you need to match it to the Ai
surface. Click on the \{Link\} button on the unmatched surface at the
bottom, then click on the Screen 1 surface at the top (or you can click
**"Link to new Surface"** to automatically create a new surface and link to
it).

![Synergy Settings Window linking a screen](/docs/images/Synergy-Settings-Window-linking-a-screen.png)

The Screen 1 Surface will now show that it is linked to the Ai server and the unmatched server at the bottom disappears.

![Synergy Settings Window with a linked screen](/docs/images/Synergy-Settings-Window-with-a-linked-screen.png)

You can link the Screen 1 Surface to one or more different physical
outputs on the Ai server by clicking the screen, then clicking the
output to connect on the left, for example if you want to show the same
media on several screens.

Once a layer is linked, if you open the layer properties in Ai the
**"Synergy Control"** box will show *"Enabled"*. Now you cannot control the
screen using Ai, only from the Titan console.

![Avolites Ai Layer Adjustments](/docs/images/Avolites-Ai-Layer-Adjustments.png)

To add a layer, click on the surface, then the \{+\} button at the bottom
and select **Layer** from the popup.

To delete a layer or surface, select the item then click the \{Rubbish Bin\}
button at the bottom, or press \<Delete\> then click the layer/surface. If
linked to Ai, this will also delete the layer/surface in Ai.

Synergy Fixtures Window
-----------------------

Every layer on the Ai server appears as a button in the Synergy Fixtures
window. You can display this using the button at the bottom of the
[Synergy Settings window](#synergy-setup) or from \[Open Workspace Windows\].

![Synergy Fixtures Workspace Window](/docs/images/Synergy-Fixtures-Workspace-Window.png)

You use these buttons to select one or more layers for control, just as
you would select lighting fixtures to control. Once selected, use the
[Attribute Editor](operating-synergy.md#attribute-editor-for-controlling-ai-layers) or [wheels](../controlling-fixtures/using-the-select-buttons-and-wheels.md#changing-attributes-using-the-wheels) to control the media playback and effects on
the Ai server. You can then [store palettes](../palettes/creating-palettes.md) and [playbacks](../cues/creating-a-cue.md#creating-a-cue) as with any
other lighting fixture. This is described in the next section, [Operating Synergy](operating-synergy.md).

> The Synergy layers are shown in their own window to keep them
together and help you find them quickly. However if you prefer you
can move the layer buttons into the normal Fixtures window.
