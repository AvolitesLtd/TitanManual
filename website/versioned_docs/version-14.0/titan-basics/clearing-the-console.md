When you start a new show on Titan it is usually a good idea to clear
the console. All programming and patching is deleted, and user options
are returned to default settings.

1. Press the \<Disk\> button.

2. Press \[New Show\].

3. Press \[OK\] to confirm.

4. Press \<Exit\> to leave Disk mode.

-   When starting a new show you have the option to keep existing DMX
    settings. This preserves the DMX/TitanNet configuration of the
    console which determines how the XLR sockets on the back of the
    console are used and how DMX is sent over the network.

-   There is also an option \[Wipe\] in the System menu which has the
    same function, this option is provided for Avolites oldies who are
    used to the "classic" Avolites software.
