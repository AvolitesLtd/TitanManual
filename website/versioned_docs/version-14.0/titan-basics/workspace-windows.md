The main area of the screen contains the workspace windows. These
contain buttons and controls for selecting fixtures, groups, palettes, and playbacks,
for controlling fixture attributes, showing cue lists, or the visualiser, in fact there is
a workspace window for every feature of the console.

The windows can be freely arranged and each monitor can have its own arrangement of windows.
You can save different layouts to the Workspace select buttons
which allows you to instantly reconfigure the console for different tasks. The
saved layouts can change just the monitor they are on, or all monitors together.

The picture below shows a typical arrangement of workspace windows.

![Workspaces](/docs/images/Titan-Touch-Screen-User-Interface.png)


## Opening and Positioning Workspace Windows

Double press the \<View\> button (labelled \<Open\> or \<Open Window\> on some consoles)
to show the workspace open buttons overlay on all monitors (for the rest of this manual
we'll refer to this button as \<View/Open\>). On the monitor where you
want the workspace, press the appropriate button and the window will open on that monitor.

![Workspace Window Selection](/docs/images/Workspace-Windows-Icons.png)

If the window was already open on a different monitor, it will move to the monitor you selected
keeping the same size and position.

You can also use the \[Open
Workspace Window\] menu command on the root menu to show the workspace open buttons.
Pressing \<View/Open\> again will close the workspace button overlay, or pressing the X
at the top of the button overlay on any screen will close it on all screens.


There are also button shortcuts to open some of the windows:

### Shortcuts to Open Workspace Windows

- \<View/Open\> then an Attribute Bank button opens the Palette
window for that attribute.

- \<View/Open\> then \<Patch\> opens the Patch View window.

- \<View/Open\> then a fixture select button opens the Fixture
View window showing patch details for that fixture.

- \<View/Open\> then \<Connect/Cue\> opens the Playback View window.

- \<View/Open\> then \<Off\> opens the Active Playbacks window.

- \<View/Open\> then \<Macro\> opens the Macro window.

### Changing window size and appearance

At the top right of each workspace window are three or four buttons
which access other functions for the window.

The **Window Appearance Options** button (\{Cog\} button) lets you select the
standard window sizes and positions (top left quarter, top right quarter etc.)
Buttons are also shown allowing you
to set the button size and the text size of the buttons in the window, and move the
window to a different monitor. The Appearance options may vary depending
on which window it is, the setup of the console and if you have any
external monitors. The Rows / Columns buttons allow you to control how buttons are
arranged, see [Controlling button layout/grid](../titan-basics/workspace-windows.md#controlling-button-layoutgrid).

![Window Appearance Menu](/docs/images/Window-Appearance-Options.png)

The **Resize Window** button allows you to set adjustable window sizes.
A grid screen will open.

![Resize](/docs/images/Resize.png)

With the softkey \[Edit All Windows\] set to Off, you just set the size
of the selected window.

Touch and drag the top left or bottom right corners to resize the
window. Touch and drag anywhere else to move the window.

Tap on a corner to set a start corner position - the window will
highlight in red and ask you to tap to set the opposite corner position.

If the softkey \[Resize Neighbours\] is set to On, surrounding windows
will resize to make room for the window you are editing. If Off, the
other windows will stay the same size and go behind the current window.

If \[Edit All Windows\] is set to On, corner arrows will appear in all
windows and you can adjust the size of all the windows together. Press
\<Enter\>, \<Exit\> or \[OK\] to finish.

![Resize](/docs/images/Resize-2.png)

> If you accidentally set a window to a single grid size, you can't then get to the Window Layout button to resize it. Select the window and use the \[Min/Max\] softkey to set the window to a fixed size.

You can move the active window between screens from the Window
Appearance screen, or by pressing View then \[Window Options\] then
\[Move Screen\], or hold \<Avo\> and press the \<Size & Position\> button.

You can close the active window using the \<Close\> button (not on all
consoles). You can close all windows by pressing \<Avo\>+\<Close\>, or
use the \[Close All\] softkey.

### Context Menu Buttons

On all consoles apart from Sapphire Touch and Titan Go, **context menu 
buttons** are automatically shown below the prompt area on the top right 
of the main screen. These buttons contain useful functions for the current
active window and change depending on the window. \
The picture below gives an example of
how the context buttons appear when Patch View window is active.

![Context Menu](/docs/images/Context-Menu.png)

On Sapphire Touch and Titan Go each window has a **Context Menu button** 
in the top window bar, which gives a drop down menu showing the
context menu buttons for the current window.

![Patch View](/docs/images/Patch-View-2.png)



### Controlling Button Layout/Grid

Buttons normally resize automatically to suit the screen size and
resolution, however this means that moving shows between different
consoles or different screens can make the number of rows and columns
change, causing buttons to move around. If you have set a particular
layout you want to keep (for example if you've positioned fixtures in
the window to match the layout on stage), open the Window Appearance
menu using the \{Cog\} button and set Button Size to \{Button Size Set Rows
& Columns\}. You can then set a fixed layout using the \{Rows\} and
\{Columns\} buttons.

![Rows and Columns](/docs/images/Rows-and-Columns.png)

The Rows and Columns settings are remembered even if you change the
button size back to one of the automatic sizes, which allows you to swap
between auto and fixed button size modes.


Saving Workspace Layouts
-----------------------

You can save workspace layouts, allowing you to reconfigure either all the windows on one
screen, or all the windows on all the screens, at the touch of a button.

Workspace layouts are saved to the Workspaces touch buttons to the left
of the A-G menu buttons and above the wheel displays (except on Sapphire Touch and Titan Go where
they are down the left side of the screen).

![Workspaces](/docs/images/Recoding-a-Workspace-Layout.png)

External screens can have their own workspace buttons down the side of the screen (these
can be turned on or off in the [User Settings](../system-settings/user-settings/#display) .)

To record, press \<View/Open\> then
\[Record Workspace\], then touch one of the Workspaces buttons, or just
touch an empty button twice to Quick Record. You can also save
workspaces onto any grey handle or macro button.

When saving and loading workspaces, it's often useful to be able to set how existing windows
will behave if you load more windows, and to be able to target particular windows to a certain screen on the console.

-   \[Record Visible/All Windows\] lets you set whether the workspace
    will contain only the windows which are currently visible, or will
    also include any windows which are hidden underneath other windows.

-   \[Remove/Leave other windows on recall\] sets whether all other
    windows will be closed when this workspace is recalled. If set to remove,
	the Workspace button will show an \{X\} in the corner.
	
	![Workspaces](/docs/images/Workspace-Layout-Button-Letters-X.png)

-   \[Screens=\] sets whether the workspace layout will record all the screens,
    or individual screens (you can select or deselect each screen).

-   \[Recall as Recorded / Where Selected\] only appears if the Screens option
    is set to record only a single screen, and sets whether the workspace will
	recall onto the screen where you recorded it (button shows S + the screen number), or if it will recall onto
	the screen where you selected it (button shows a target symbol).
	![Workspaces](/docs/images/Workspace-Layout-Button-Letters.png)

-   To delete a workspace button, press \<View/Open\>, \<Delete\>, then
    the workspace button to be deleted.

-	When recalling a workspace, if you press \<View/Open\> first then softkey buttons let you
	set the workspace to recall to the particular screen where it was recorded \[As Recorded\], or to a different screen
	(the other screen numbers are listed on softkeys). This is useful when a workspace contains only a single screen,
	allowing you to recall it onto a different screen.
	

>	**Screen numbering**\
	On consoles with a single internal screen, that is (1) and the external screen is (2).
	On Arena 	the main screen is (1), the mini screen (2) and the external screen (3). 
	On Sapphire Touch the right main screen is (1), the left main screen is (2) and the external screens are (3) and (4).

As an example of setting up a workspace, suppose while programming you
wanted to be able to access fixtures, position palettes, fixture
attributes and shapes:

1. Double press the \<View/Open\> button, or press \<Exit\> to get to the root menu and then the \[Open Workspace
Window\] menu softkey.

2. Find the \{Fixtures\} icon on the screen and press it.

3. If the window is not in the top left quarter, press the \<Size &
Position\> button (above the numeric keys) until the window occupies the
top left quarter. Or press the \{Cog\} button on the window
top bar and press the top left position button in that window.

4. Double press \<View/Open\>  again and select the \{Positions\}
window. Press the \<Size & Position\> button to position it in the desired
location.

5. Repeat to activate the \{Attribute Editor\} and \{Effects\} windows.

6. Press \<View/Open\> then \[Record Workspace\], or hold \<Avo\> and
press \<View/Open\>. Type in a name for the workspace. Then touch the
Workspace button where you want to store this workspace layout. Or, you
can use Quick Record -- just touch an empty workspace button and it will
turn red with a +. Type a name for the workspace and touch again to
store it.

## Quick Record

![Quick Record](/docs/images/Recoding-a-Workspace-Layout.png) Some windows - Groups, Workspaces,
and all the Palette windows - have a Quick Record function.
Set up what you want to record, then touch or click an empty button
once. The button will light up red with a + sign. At this point you can
enter a legend. Touch or click again to store the item.

The Quick Record function can be disabled for a particular button type using [Key Profiles](../system-settings/key-profiles.md).

For palette buttons, the quick record function works slightly differently to pressing \<Record\> followed by the button. See [Storing a Palette](../palettes/creating-palettes#storing-a-palette).

## Legends and Picture Legends

All touch buttons can have legends set to remind you what they do. In
addition, you can draw picture legends on the buttons. To do this,
select \[Set Legend\] then press \[Picture\]. A drawing space will open
on the touch screen for you to draw the legend. There is also a library
of pictures to choose from including popular gobo designs.

Colour palettes will automatically create a picture legend showing the
colour(s) in the palette when you save it. Gobo palettes will show an
image of the standard gobo, if the fixture personality has this
information in it.

![Gobos and Beams Workspace Window](/docs/images/Gobos-and-Beams-Workspace-Window.png)

## Button Halo

You can set a custom coloured halo for fixture, group or palette
buttons. This can be really useful for identifying different types of
button at a glance. Select the \[Halo\] option on the Set Legends menu.

![Halo](/docs/images/Fixture-Halo.png)

If you set a [halo on fixture buttons](../patching/changing-the-patch.md#fixture-button-halo), the halo colour is also used in other windows; fixture buttons can also have an automatic halo to help identify different types of fixture, which is also used in the patch window.


## Touch Keyboard

At the end of the toolbar is the keyboard popup button which will open
the touch keyboard.

![Keyboard Button](/docs/images/Keyboard-Button.png)

The touch keyboard can be switched between large and small size using
the Max/Min button and you close it using the large \{X\} button in the top
right hand corner. You can also move it on the screen by touching and
dragging the blank area of the keyboard at the top.

If you want the keyboard to pop up automatically when text input is
required, set the \{Man/Auto\} button to "Auto". This setting will stay
active until you change it back to "Manual".

The small version of the keyboard (pictured) does not have some of the
less frequently used buttons.

![Touch Screen Keyboard](/docs/images/Keyboard.png)


## Trackball (Sapphire Touch only)

The trackball on the right of the console can be used either to control
the mouse pointer on the touch screens and external monitors, or to
control fixtures.

To use in mouse mode, hold the \<Assign\> button below the trackball and
click the \'Left\' mouse button. The trackball will then control the
mouse pointer and the ring will scroll windows up and down.

To use in console mode for controlling fixtures, press the \<Assign\>
button on its own. The trackball will control pan and tilt of selected
fixtures, and the ring controls fine tilt.

## Mini Screen (Arena only)

The \<Display\> button below the rotary encoders toggles through four
fixed layouts for the Mini screen:

- Workspace window(s) with encoder legends on the right
![Arena Miniscreen](/docs/images/Arena-Miniscreen.png)

- Workspace window(s) with macro button legends below
![Mini Screen Macros](/docs/images/Mini-Screen-Macros.png)


- Fixed playbacks window - in this mode the first two rows of touch
buttons are the same as the macro buttons below. This window cannot be
moved to another screen, and other windows open on the Mini screen will
move to the main screen when this layout is set.

- Workspace window(s) fill the full screen, no button/encoder legends
shown.


## Compatibility Windows for Pearl Expert Shows

The "Fixtures and Playbacks" and "Groups and Palettes" windows allow you
to access the preset fader handles in shows which have been programmed
on the Pearl Expert.

When either of these windows is opened, there is a context button option
to \{Move to workspace\}. This will move the handles from the
compatibility window to the appropriate workspace window. You need to do
this twice, once with the "Fixtures and playbacks" window selected, and
once with the "Palettes and groups" window selected.
