A TNP (TitanNet Processor) unit can operate either as a slave unit,
producing additional DMX lines for a console, or as a simple console for
stand-alone operation. In console mode you can prepare a show on a full
console, then load it into a TNP for operation, using [power-on playbacks](cues/using-a-cue.md#programming-the-release-power-on-state), or you can connect an external
touchscreen to the TNP and operate it using the Titan Go interface
screen.
