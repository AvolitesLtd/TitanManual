This manual covers all types of Avolites console, and while the operation
of Titan is pretty much the same on all of them, the layout and connectivity
of each console is different.

This section has details
about each individual console design in turn, showing where the controls are and
how they differ between consoles, and the various connections available on the
back panel.

The USB connected [T1 and T2](about-the-consoles/t1-and-t2.md) devices are also 
described, and the [TNP network processing unit](about-the-consoles/tnp.md).

In addition, the different console extension [fader wings](about-the-consoles/fader-wings.md) are covered.
