As well as being used to store [static cues](cues.md), the playback faders can also
be used to store chases (sequences of cues). You can also store chases
on touch buttons in the Playbacks window.

Chases can run once or repeat continuously. You can set [individual fade
time for each cue](chases/chase-timing.md#individual-cue-times-in-chases) in the chase
and [unlink cues](chases/chase-options.md#linking) so that the console waits
for you to press Go before the chase continues.

> If you are programming patterns with a lot of fixtures, consider using
[Key Frame Shapes](effects/key-frame-shapes.md) in place of chases, as they give you more facilities to
vary the look.
