The **Shape Generator** in Titan (sometimes known as an Effects Generator on
other consoles) allows you to quickly create exciting light shows using
lots of movement and changes, with the minimum of programming. A range
of speed controls allow you to modify how the shapes appear at show time
giving you a whole range of effects from a few basic stored [cues](cues.md).

You can use the conventional 
[Shape Generator](effects/shape-generator.md) with preset patterns, or
the [Key Frame Shape Generator](effects/key-frame-shapes.md) which allows you to create your own custom
patterns.

The [Pixel Mapper](effects/pixel-mapper.md) is used to generate animated textures using the colour
or intensity of a group of fixtures (often LED battens, starcloths or
LED web type fixtures). When viewed at a distance the effect becomes
clearly visible.
