This section describes how to copy, move and delete entire cue lists. 
The [Editing Cue Lists](editing-cue-lists.md) section describes how you [copy, move and delete
individual cues within a cue list](editing-cue-lists.md#moving-copying-and-deleting-individual-cues).

## Copying or Moving a Cue List

Using the <Keys.HardKey>Copy</Keys.HardKey> and <Keys.HardKey>Move</Keys.HardKey> buttons, cue lists can be copied or moved to a new playback, or you can create a
linked copy of a playback. Move is useful for tidying up the console. Linked copies are
useful if you want the same cue list to appear on different playback pages.

This operation is exactly the same as for Cues and is described in
[Copying, Moving, Linking and Deleting](../cues/copying-moving-linking-and-deleting.md).

## Deleting a Cue List

You can delete a whole cue list by pressing <Keys.HardKey>Delete</Keys.HardKey> then the **Select**
button of the playback to be deleted. Confirm the deletion by pressing
the select button again, or the <Keys.SoftKey>Confirm</Keys.SoftKey> softkey, or <Keys.HardKey>Enter</Keys.HardKey>.
