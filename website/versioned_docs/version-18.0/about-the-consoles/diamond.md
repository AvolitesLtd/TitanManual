The Diamond 9 has the following main control areas. There are two models, the 
D9-330 as shown and the compact D9-215 which has two main touchscreens and
fewer playback faders:

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>A</Keys.Annotation> The three main **Touch screens** (two on D9-215) contain fixture, palette and group select
buttons. At the bottom of the right-hand screen, the current wheel assignments
are shown along with legends for the 15 Macro Keys. At the top and bottom of
the left-hand screen(s), handle legends for the main faders and encoders are shown.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>B</Keys.Annotation> The **Playback faders** and **Rotary playback faders** select and control cues, cue lists and chases, and other configurable functions. (D9-215 only has the right hand set of faders).

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>C</Keys.Annotation> The **System Prompt and Menu Softkeys** have their own touchscreen.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>D</Keys.Annotation> The **Programming and setup controls** configure and program the console,
within which the **editor touchscreen** shows and sets fixture attributes and 
the **macro/executor buttons** are playback buttons allowing storage of cues or
chases, frequent key sequences, screen layouts or groups. To the left of these
controls are the cue list playback controls and the Scene Master T-bar.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>E</Keys.Annotation> Three **Layer screens** are provided for monitoring
video feeds via NDI, or for additional workspace window touch screens.



## Touch screen controls

![Diamond-F-G](/docs/images/Diamond-F.png)

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>F</Keys.Annotation> The **Workspace windows** on the touch screens contain a user-configurable
layout of touch buttons for fixtures, palettes, groups, playbacks, macros and more.
You can also show the integrated Capture visualiser, video feed monitors or a range
of information screens such as intensity levels or DMX output levels.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>G</Keys.Annotation> The **System Prompt and Menu Softkeys** screen is the nerve centre of
the console and shows you what is going on. This display contains touch
buttons for the main menu which change depending on what the console
is doing. Softkey commands are shown in the manual 
like this: <Keys.SoftKey>Edit Times</Keys.SoftKey>

## Playbacks

![Diamond-H](/docs/images/Diamond-H.png)

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>H</Keys.Annotation> The **Rotary Faders** and buttons at the top can be used to store
a range of program functions including cues, chases, and fixture groups.
The rotary faders have a level indicator around them which is shown in
a user-configurable colour (halo colour).
The touch screen below the faders shows legends indicating their function.
There are additional rotary faders down the sides of the left and right touchscreens.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>I</Keys.Annotation> The **Page Select buttons** in the
centre of the faders let you change the left or right fader banks to a different page.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>J</Keys.Annotation> Two more sets of **Rotary Faders** are provided above the Playback Faders.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>K</Keys.Annotation> The motorised **Playback faders** and buttons are the main place to store and play back cues or chases
but can also be assigned a range of other functions. Each fader has a level indicator
which can be set to a user-configurable halo colour.
The touch screen above the faders shows information about
each playback.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>L</Keys.Annotation> 
The **Page Select buttons** let you change the left or right
fader banks to a different page
of playbacks (for both the playback faders and the lower rotary faders). 

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>M</Keys.Annotation> The **Macro Buttons** store playbacks or frequently used sequences of keypresses
which can be replayed with a single button press. The display immediately above the buttons shows legends for
the buttons. There is a smaller bank of 6 buttons between the playback faders with
their own legend screen.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>N</Keys.Annotation> The **Playback controls** are used to control the playback of cue
lists and include a T-bar with display for the Scene Master function and 
a motorised fader pair in the Sequence Control Section to control the 
connected playback/master.

## Programming controls

![Diamond-N](/docs/images/Diamond-O.png)

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>O</Keys.Annotation> The five  **Control wheels** are used to set control values (attributes) for
the fixtures, and to set chase speeds and fades. The touch screen above
the wheels shows information about the attributes being controlled. The buttons
to the right of the wheels switch them to other functions such as fade timing,
shape control or visualiser control.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>P</Keys.Annotation> The dedicated **Editor Touchscreen** shows the Attribute Editor
window giving a different way to select attributes such as colours and gobos.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>Q</Keys.Annotation> The **Function buttons** are used to carry out functions such as storing
cues, copying, patching, saving to disk, etc.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>R</Keys.Annotation> The **Attribute Buttons** are used to select which attributes of
a fixture (e.g. colour, gobo, pan, focus) are going to be controlled
using the Control wheels. The buttons light up to show you which
attributes are active.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>S</Keys.Annotation> The **Numeric keypad** and other control buttons are used to enter
values and change controls on the console.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>T</Keys.Annotation> The dedicated **Intensity Wheel** and display controls intensity
of selected fixtures.

&nbsp;<Keys.Annotation>U</Keys.Annotation> The **trackball** controls pan and tilt of fixtures, and can also be
used to control a mouse pointer for the screens.

## Front edge of the console

Under the armrest at the front of the console is the **Power Switch**, a
**USB socket** for connecting USB drives, and a pull-out drawer with an 
illuminated **Keyboard** for entering legends.

The front edge of the console has built-in LED illumination, useful for reading a script or notes. Press the reading light switch next to the keyboard drawer to turn this light on or off. If you hold down this button for 2-5 seconds it will turn on or off the red backlighting behind the screens.
