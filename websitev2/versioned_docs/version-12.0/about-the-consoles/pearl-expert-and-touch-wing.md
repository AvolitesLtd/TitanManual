## The Main Controls

<Keys.Annotation>E</Keys.Annotation> The <strong>Preset Faders</strong> are used to control individual dimmer channels and
fixture intensities. Cues and chases can also be stored on these faders.
The 2 buttons below the faders are used to select and flash whatever is
stored on the fader. Each fader and buttons is called a \'Handle\'.

<Keys.Annotation>F</Keys.Annotation> The <strong>Page select rollers</strong> let you select different pages of playbacks,
and you can write the playback names on the rollers so you know what's
in them. There are 2 rollers each controlling 10 playback faders

<Keys.Annotation>G</Keys.Annotation> The <strong>Master faders</strong> control the overall output of the various parts of
the console. You will normally have these set at Full.

<Keys.Annotation>H</Keys.Annotation> The <strong>Playback faders</strong> and flash buttons are used to play back cues or
chases you have programmed, when you are running a show.

<Keys.Annotation>I</Keys.Annotation> The <strong>Main display</strong> is the nerve centre of the console and shows you
what is going on. The display can show various screens of information.

and to set chase speeds and fades.

<Keys.Annotation>K</Keys.Annotation> The <strong>Menu softkeys</strong> (labelled A -- G) are used to select control
options. The display next to the buttons shows what each one will do.
The options for each key change depending on what the console is doing.

to indicate when they are active.

<Keys.Annotation>O</Keys.Annotation> The <strong>Attribute select buttons</strong> are used to select which attributes of
a fixture (e.g. colour, gobo, pan, focus) are going to be controlled
using the Control wheels. The buttons have lights on to show you which
attributes are active. The bottom (red) button allows you to locate
fixtures, which sets them to a known start position while programming.
