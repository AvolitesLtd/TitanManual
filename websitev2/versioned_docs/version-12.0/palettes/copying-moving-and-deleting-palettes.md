Copying or Moving a Palette
---------------------------

Using the <Keys.HardKey>Copy</Keys.HardKey> button you can make a copy of an existing palette or
move it to a new button. You can copy or move multiple palettes in one
operation. You cannot link palette buttons.

Move is useful for tidying up the console.

1. Press <Keys.HardKey>Copy</Keys.HardKey>

2. Select <Keys.SoftKey>Copy</Keys.SoftKey> or <Keys.SoftKey>Move</Keys.SoftKey>. Pressing the <Keys.HardKey>Copy</Keys.HardKey> button again will
also toggle these options. Some consoles have a <Keys.HardKey>Move</Keys.HardKey> button.

3. Press the **Select** button of the palette you want to copy/move. You
can select multiple palettes - use the <Keys.HardKey>Thro</Keys.HardKey> and <Keys.HardKey>And</Keys.HardKey> buttons to
add more to the selection - hold down <Keys.HardKey>And</Keys.HardKey> to keep adding them.

4. Press the empty button where you want it to go

---

-   The <Keys.HardKey>Menu Latch</Keys.HardKey> button latches the **Copy/Move/Link menu**, so you
    can keep copying, moving or linking things without having to keep
    pressing <Keys.HardKey>Copy</Keys.HardKey>. Press <Keys.HardKey>Menu Latch</Keys.HardKey> again to unlatch.

-   <Keys.SoftKey>Retain Layout</Keys.SoftKey> or <Keys.SoftKey>Bunch Up</Keys.SoftKey> is used when copying a group of
    palettes with empty handles in the group - you can either keep the
    empty handles, or bunch up the used handles together.

-   When in Copy mode, option <Keys.SoftKey>Copy Legends</Keys.SoftKey> can be changed to \[Don't
    copy legends\] so that the copied palettes are given default
    legends.

-   When in Move mode, <Keys.SoftKey>Swap Items if Required</Keys.SoftKey> will attempt to
    reposition any existing handles which are in the way of the move.
    This is useful when rearranging buttons on a page which is nearly
    full.

Deleting Palettes
-----------------

You can delete a palette entry by pressing <Keys.HardKey>Delete</Keys.HardKey>, then pressing the
palette's button to be deleted. Press the palette button again to
confirm the deletion. For palettes stored on physical buttons you can
delete a range of palettes in one go by holding down the first one while
pressing the last one.

Other ways to delete a palette:

-   If the console has an <Keys.HardKey>Update Palette</Keys.HardKey> button, press it, then
    select a palette, then use the <Keys.SoftKey>Delete</Keys.SoftKey> softkey option

-   Press the <Keys.HardKey>Palette</Keys.HardKey> button above the numeric keypad and use the
    <Keys.SoftKey>Delete</Keys.SoftKey> option in the <Keys.SoftKey>Palette Utilities</Keys.SoftKey> menu

-   Press <Keys.HardKey>Delete</Keys.HardKey> then <Keys.SoftKey>Palette</Keys.SoftKey>, type the palette number, press
    <Keys.HardKey>Enter</Keys.HardKey>

>   If you have playbacks which use the deleted palette, they will go
    back to the values which were stored in the programmer when the
    playback was recorded
