Copying or Moving a Palette
---------------------------

Using the \<Copy\> button you can make a copy of an existing palette or
move it to a new button. You can copy or move multiple palettes in one
operation. You cannot link palette buttons.

Move is useful for tidying up the console.

1. Press \<Copy\>

2. Select \[Copy\] or \[Move\]. Pressing the \<Copy\> button again will
also toggle these options. Some consoles have a \<Move\> button.

3. Press the **Select** button of the palette you want to copy/move. You
can select multiple palettes - use the \<Thro\> and \<And\> buttons to
add more to the selection - hold down \<And\> to keep adding them.

4. Press the empty button where you want it to go

---

-   The \<Menu Latch\> button latches the **Copy/Move/Link menu**, so you
    can keep copying, moving or linking things without having to keep
    pressing \<Copy\>. Press \<Menu Latch\> again to unlatch.

-   \[Retain Layout\] or \[Bunch Up\] is used when copying a group of
    palettes with empty handles in the group - you can either keep the
    empty handles, or bunch up the used handles together.

-   When in Copy mode, option \[Copy Legends\] can be changed to \[Don't
    copy legends\] so that the copied palettes are given default
    legends.

-   When in Move mode, \[Swap Items if Required\] will attempt to
    reposition any existing handles which are in the way of the move.
    This is useful when rearranging buttons on a page which is nearly
    full.

Deleting Palettes
-----------------

You can delete a palette entry by pressing \<Delete\>, then pressing the
palette's button to be deleted. Press the palette button again to
confirm the deletion. For palettes stored on physical buttons you can
delete a range of palettes in one go by holding down the first one while
pressing the last one.

Other ways to delete a palette:

-   If the console has an \<Update Palette\> button, press it, then
    select a palette, then use the \[Delete\] softkey option

-   Press the \<Palette\> button above the numeric keypad and use the
    \[Delete\] option in the \[Palette Utilities\] menu

-   Press \<Delete\> then \[Palette\], type the palette number, press
    \<Enter\>

>   If you have playbacks which use the deleted palette, they will go
    back to the values which were stored in the programmer when the
    playback was recorded
