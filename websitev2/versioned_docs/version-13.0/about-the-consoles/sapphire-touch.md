fixture attributes and show information windows.

<Keys.Annotation>N</Keys.Annotation> The **trackball** controls pan and tilt of fixtures, and can also be
used to control the mouse pointer for the screens.

<Keys.Annotation>O</Keys.Annotation> The **Numeric keypad** and other control buttons are used to enter
values and change controls on the console.

<Keys.Annotation>P</Keys.Annotation> The **Function buttons** are used to carry out functions such as storing
cues, copying, patching, saving to disk, etc.

<Keys.Annotation>Q</Keys.Annotation> The **Attribute select buttons** are used to select which attributes of
a fixture (e.g. colour, gobo, pan, focus) are going to be controlled
using the Control wheels. The buttons have lights on to show you which
attributes are active. The Red button just below allows you to locate
fixtures, which sets them to a known start position while programming.
