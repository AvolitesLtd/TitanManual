Copying or Moving a Cue
-----------------------

Using the <Keys.HardKey>Copy</Keys.HardKey> button you can make a **copy** of an existing cue, **move**
it to a new playback, or create a new playback which is **linked** to the
existing playback. You can **copy**, **move** or **link** multiple playbacks (which
may be cues, [chases](../chases.md) or [cue lists](../cue-lists.md)) in one operation.

Move is useful for tidying up the console. Linked cues are handy if you
want a cue to appear on more than one page for ease of operation; also
the linked cue can have different [timings](cue-timing.md) and 
[playback options](playback-options.md) from the cue it's linked to.

1. Press <Keys.HardKey>Copy</Keys.HardKey>

2. Select <Keys.SoftKey>Copy</Keys.SoftKey>, <Keys.SoftKey>Move</Keys.SoftKey> or <Keys.SoftKey>Link</Keys.SoftKey>. Pressing <Keys.HardKey>Copy</Keys.HardKey> again will
also toggle these options. Some consoles have a <Keys.HardKey>Move</Keys.HardKey> button to get
straight into Move mode.

3. Press the **select** button of the cue you want to **copy**/**move**/**link**. You
can select a range of playbacks by holding the first button while
pressing the last in the range, or use the <Keys.HardKey>Thro</Keys.HardKey> and <Keys.HardKey>And</Keys.HardKey> buttons
to add more playbacks to the selection - hold down <Keys.HardKey>And</Keys.HardKey> to keep
adding them.

4. Press the empty select button where you want it to go.

-   The <Keys.HardKey>Menu Latch</Keys.HardKey> button latches the **Copy/Move/Link menu**, so you
    can keep copying, moving or linking things without having to keep
    pressing the button. The latched menu will stay active until you
    press <Keys.HardKey>Menu Latch</Keys.HardKey> to unlatch it.

-   <Keys.SoftKey>Retain Layout</Keys.SoftKey> or <Keys.SoftKey>Bunch Up</Keys.SoftKey> is used when copying a group of
    cues with empty playbacks in the group - you can either keep the
    empty playbacks, or bunch up the used playbacks together.

-   When in **Copy** mode, the option <Keys.SoftKey>Copy Legends</Keys.SoftKey> can be changed to <Keys.SoftKey>Don't
    copy legends</Keys.SoftKey> so that the copied cues are given default legends.

-   When in Move mode, <Keys.SoftKey>Swap Items if Required</Keys.SoftKey> will attempt to
    reposition any existing playbacks which are in the way of the move.
    This is useful when rearranging playbacks on a page which is nearly
    full.

Deleting a Cue
--------------

To delete a cue:

1. Press the <Keys.HardKey>Delete</Keys.HardKey> button

2. Press the **select** button of the cue you want to delete

3. Press the **select** button again (or press <Keys.HardKey>Enter</Keys.HardKey>) to confirm the
delete

---

-   Instead of deleting the cue you can select <Keys.SoftKey>Unassign</Keys.SoftKey>, this will
    remove the cue from the handle but retain it for future use. Go to
    the [Show Library](../titan-basics/show-library.md) to reuse unassigned cues.

-   Press <Keys.HardKey>Menu Latch</Keys.HardKey> to keep the delete mode active. You can keep
    deleting using **steps 2 and 3** without having to keep pressing the
    <Keys.HardKey>Delete</Keys.HardKey> button. Press <Keys.HardKey>Menu Latch</Keys.HardKey> to exit latched delete mode.
