import Keys from '@site/src/components/key.ts';

The System menu is accessed by holding <Keys.HardKey>Avo</Keys.HardKey> and pressing <Keys.HardKey>Disk</Keys.HardKey>, or 
on Titan Go you can press the <Keys.HardKey>System</Keys.HardKey> button. Some
older consoles are also fitted with a key switch or mode switch to get the
System menu.

The options in this menu are separated from the other options on the
console because you would normally only change them occasionally, or
because they can have serious effects on the way the console works and
you wouldn't want to change them accidentally.

---

Network Settings
----------------

This option sets up networking parameters for the Ethernet ports on the console - further details on how to [control fixtures over a network](../networking/controlling-fixtures-over-a-network.md) are in the [networking section](../networking.md).

DMX Settings
------------

Allows you to configure how the console outputs DMX. This option is
described in detail later in this chapter, in the [DMX Output Settings section](dmx-output-mapping.md#configuring-dmx-outputs).

DMX Merge Settings
------------------

Allows you to select how DMX will be output across multiple consoles or
processing nodes - [read more about DMX merge settings](dmx-output-mapping.md#dmx-merge).

Synergy Settings
----------------

Sets up the Synergy software for linking to an Ai server, see the [Synergy setup section](../synergy/setting-up.md#synergy-setup).

TitanNet Security
-----------------

This option sets how the console communicates with other Titan devices
as a backup console, for more information see the [Linking consoles for multi-user or backup](../running-the-show/linking-consoles-for-multi-user-or-backup.md) section.

User Settings
-------------

The User Settings menu may also be accessed from Program mode: hold down
the <Keys.HardKey>Avo</Keys.HardKey> button and press <Keys.SoftKey>User Settings</Keys.SoftKey>. See the [User Settings](user-settings.md) section.

Key Profiles
------------

Allows you to modify the functions of some buttons. See section the [Key Profiles](key-profiles.md) section.

Wipe
----

The Wipe menu erases the current show. This is the same as the \[New
Show\] option on the Disk menu, but is provided here for old fashioned
Avolites users who are used to it being on the System menu.

Triggers
--------

Sets up the console for external triggering such as MIDI or DMX-in. This
option is described in detail in the [MIDI, DMX or audio triggering](../running-the-show/midi-dmx-or-audio-triggering.md) section.

Assign Masters
--------------

This option allows you to assign any playback fader to be a master
fader. Various different types of master fader may be assigned. See
section [Grand Master fader and assignable masters](../running-the-show/playback-controls.md#grand-master-fader-and-assignable-masters) for more
information.

Console Legend
--------------

Lets you set the legend of the console, this is displayed in networking
screens when you are linking the console to others.

Titan Telemetry
---------------

To help Avolites with software development and bug fixing, the console
will report anonymous information to Avolites. This includes details
about faults that occur, statistics on how long certain functions take,
and usage of functions. This information is really useful for improving
the software, however if you would prefer to disable it, click the
<Keys.SoftKey>Telemetry Enabled</Keys.SoftKey> button to switch it to <Keys.SoftKey>Telemetry Disabled</Keys.SoftKey>.
Telemetry information will only be sent in any case if the console is
connected to the internet.

Display Setup
-------------

This option gives you a menu for enabling and disabling [external
monitor(s)](external-displays.md). If you don't have a monitor connected, set this option to
"Disabled" to improve the performance of the console.
