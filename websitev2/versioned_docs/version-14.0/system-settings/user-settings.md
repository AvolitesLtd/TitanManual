import Keys from '@site/src/components/key.ts';

The User Settings menu may be accessed from the <Keys.SoftKey>User Settings</Keys.SoftKey> softkey
on the **System** menu. You can also get it directly from any other
menu by holding down the <Keys.HardKey>Avo</Keys.HardKey> button and pressing
<Keys.SoftKey>User Settings</Keys.SoftKey>.

![User Settings Window](/docs/images/User-Settings-Window.png)

A window will open showing the user settings, or you can also set the
same options using the softkey options. User Settings are individual for
each User and you can change the User from this screen.


> Click on the <Keys.ContextKey>i</Keys.ContextKey> button for a help window on each setting.

Options are divided into categories on the softkeys or down the left
hand side.

## General

### Chase Snap
If enabled the <Keys.HardKey>Next Step</Keys.HardKey> and <Keys.HardKey>Prev Step</Keys.HardKey> buttons will snap
to the new state. If disabled, programmed fades will be shown. This is
the same function as the <Keys.HardKey>Snap</Keys.HardKey> button which features on some consoles.

### Cue List Snap
If enabled the <Keys.HardKey>Next Step</Keys.HardKey> and <Keys.HardKey>Prev Step</Keys.HardKey> buttons will
snap to the new state. If disabled, programmed fades will be shown.

### Clear Record Mask
Sets whether the record mask is cleared back to
All Enabled when you enter the Record function, or whether it remains as
you previously set it.

### Copy Cues
Sets whether tracked values will copy when you copy a cue
from a tracked cue list.

### Run Startup Playbacks
Allows you to globally disable startup
playbacks from running. To enable Startup Playbacks you need to turn
this on and set some playbacks as Startup using playback Options.

### System Render Rate (Hz)
Sets the output rate of DMX frames from
1-44 frames per second *(default 40)*. You can reduce this if processing
of a complex show is slowing down the console.

---

## Display

### External Display
Sets whether the external display is enabled or disabled.

### External Screen Workspace Shortcuts
When turned on, each screen has its own Workspace Shortcut buttons (shown
down the side of the screen on external screens). This allows you to
recall different window layouts separately on each screen rather than changing
all screens.

### Lock Screen Background
Sets a picture to be displayed when the
console is locked.

-  These options can also be set from **System** menu, in the Display Setup option.

---

##Â Handles

### Grand Master Fader

Sets whether the Grand Master fader is enabled
or disabled (some consoles do not have this fader). This can be handy if
it gets broken or if you wish to disable it to avoid confusing
inexperienced operators. The default setting is *Disabled*.

### Delete Default
Sets whether items are deleted when you press Delete
and double tap them, or whether they are released from the handle and
become unassigned. Unassigned items can be reused from the Show Library.

### Prompt Replace

Sets the console action when you try to save to a
handle or playback which is already used.

<Keys.SoftKey>Prompt for Merge or Replace</Keys.SoftKey> - the console will always prompt\
<Keys.SoftKey>Always Merge</Keys.SoftKey> - the console will never prompt\
<Keys.SoftKey>Palettes Always Merge</Keys.SoftKey> - the console will prompt unless you are
saving a palette

### Display Halo

Allows you to turn off all coloured halos on buttons.

### Fixture Halos

Sets how coloured halos are displayed on fixture
buttons.

<Keys.SoftKey>Custom</Keys.SoftKey> - Only user defined halo colours are shown.\
<Keys.SoftKey>Auto</Keys.SoftKey> - Fixture buttons are coloured using automatic fixture colours

### Handle Buttons
Sets the default size of the touch buttons to
<Keys.SoftKey>Small</Keys.SoftKey>, <Keys.SoftKey>Normal</Keys.SoftKey>, <Keys.SoftKey>Large</Keys.SoftKey> or <Keys.SoftKey>Super Size</Keys.SoftKey>. 

This can be
overridden separately in any window.

### Text Size

Sets the default size of the text used in touch buttons.
Can be overridden in any window.

### Playback Paging

<Keys.SoftKey>Playback paging</Keys.SoftKey> sets how the playback faders
behave when you change page with a playback active.\
<Keys.SoftKey>Normal</Keys.SoftKey> - sets the normal mode for the console type.\
<Keys.SoftKey>Always Hold</Keys.SoftKey> - sets the standard behaviour for non-motorised faders
where the fader keeps control of the active playback when the page is
changed and has to be lowered to zero before a playback on the new page
can be fired.\
<Keys.SoftKey>Never Hold</Keys.SoftKey> - the standard behaviour for motorised faders where the
fader always relates to the current page. To regain control of a
playback from another page you have to go back to that page and level
match the fader (which is done automatically by motorised fader). 

When a
playback is active from another page the display area goes purple and
the page number is shown at the top in light blue.

### Current Handle World
Sets the handle world - read more about [Handle Worlds](../titan-basics/multi-user-operation.md#handle-worlds).

---

## Key Profiles

Allows you to select and edit key profiles using the softkeys. See [Key Profiles](key-profiles.md) for more info.

---

## Patching

### Warn Before Parking Fixtures

Sets the console action when you patch
a fixture which overwrites the DMX channels of another fixture. This
causes the overwritten fixture to be "parked".

<Keys.SoftKey>Always</Keys.SoftKey> - console will warn you.\
<Keys.SoftKey>Never</Keys.SoftKey> - console will park the fixture without warning you.

### DMX Address
Sets whether the DMX address of fixtures is shown in
the fixture touch buttons.

### Auto Groups
Sets whether the console will automatically create new
groups for fixtures when you patch.

### Preset Palettes
Sets whether preset palettes should be created when
fixtures are patched. You can also turn this on when patching using the
<Keys.SoftKey>Create Preset Palettes</Keys.SoftKey> softkey.\
<Keys.SoftKey>Do Not Create</Keys.SoftKey> -- no palettes will be created.\
<Keys.SoftKey>Create On Workspaces</Keys.SoftKey> -- palettes will be created in workspace
windows.\
<Keys.SoftKey>Create On Presets</Keys.SoftKey> -- palettes will be created on preset buttons.

<Keys.SoftKey>Connected View Sets Chase Speed</Keys.SoftKey> means that the console will modify
the saved speed of the chase.

### Preload Time
Sets a fade time for the Preload function, normally 2
seconds. This value would normally be set for quiet fixture movement.

*HH:MM:SS* format the console will convert any number you enter into hours
minutes and seconds.

### Compensate for Rate Grand Master
If on (default), when a tempo is
tapped on a BPM master it will not be affected by the Rate Grand Master
being set to less than 100%.

entry of levels.

Sets how channel values are displayed in Cue View and
Palette View.
