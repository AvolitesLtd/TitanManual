Need to pre-program or tweak your show before you get to the venue? No
problem, just run the Titan Simulator on your PC. You can then load your
show and simulate any of the Titan consoles, using an on-screen "virtual
panel".

Installing Titan Simulator
--------------------------

You will need a Windows user account with Administrator privileges to
install or run Titan Simulator. From v12, to run the Titan Simulator an
AvoKey Simulator dongle must be connected, or a T1/T2 device.


> See [minimum PC specifications](../titan-basics.md#connecting-up-titan-mobile-and-t1t2) for details of the PC requirements.                    

- Capture visualiser requires a capable graphics card. If you have problems with Capture,      
  ensure you have installed the latest drivers for your graphics card from the manufacturer.

Simply download and run the <strong>Titan PC Suite</strong> installer from the Avolites
website. The first time you run the Editor you will need to [license the
software](../system-settings/recovering-reinstalling-the-console.md#software-licensing) to the AvoKey; follow the instructions given on screen by the
Authenticator system.

Once licensed, you have a choice of how Titan will operate:

-   If you run Titan Go with an Editor/Simulator AvoKey, you will get
    one universe of DMX (via Art-Net) with no spoilers. With a T1 or T2
    connected you will get one or two universes of DMX via XLR and
    Art-Net with no spoilers.

-   If you run a simulated console, you will get full DMX output on all
    universes but periodically random DMX values will be sent down all
    DMX outputs as a "spoiler", please wait for this to stop before
    continuing programming.

Running Titan Simulator
-----------------------

When you start Titan Simulator you need to select which console you are
simulating. The simulator will then open a Virtual Panel, which
replicates the physical controls of your chosen console, and monitor
windows for each of the monitor outputs.

> The touch screen display is shown separately from the Virtual Panel. It is helpful to have two monitors to allow you to see the touch screen and the Virtual Panel at the same time.

The Virtual Panel works exactly the same as the real panel; to hold a
button down so you can press a second button, right click it using the
mouse.

Using Virtual Panel with a console
----------------------------------

As well as its use with the simulator, you can also run the Virtual
Panel on a console. This could be handy to keep things going if you are
suffering hardware problems with the real console controls.

To show the Virtual Panel, click the Tools menu on the toolbar, then
select Other Programs, then Virtual Panel. The Virtual Panel controls
will work in parallel with the real controls.
