Normally the TNP screen shows the "Home screen" which displays the
connection status and IP address of the two Ethernet ports on the
device. Buttons across the top allow you to configure the device. The
\<Exit\> button always takes you back to the previous menu.

3. Tap \[Save Settings\] button to store the changes.

### Node Settings

For **Node Settings** you can change the legend of the device and the
line colour. This is shown on the top line of the device and on all
TitanNet pages on connected devices. It helps you identify the device
when you use the TitanNet overview on the console.

Locking the TNP
---------------

The Lock screen displays a keypad and asks you to enter a lock code.
When the device is locked, the screen shows "Locked" and shows a keypad
to unlock.

Tools

Currently there is only one option on the Tools screen, "Monitor". This
allows you to monitor the processing load of the device. You can select
to monitor either cycle time or render time.
