So you've set up a great look on the stage, and you want to save it to
use in your show.

There are four ways of recording your lighting on Titan.

<strong>Cue:</strong> This is a single look. It may contain movement in the form of
shapes, and have fade in and fade out times.

<strong>Chase:</strong> This is a timed sequence of cues, often used for an
individual effect.

<strong>Cue List:</strong> This is a linked sequence of cues, usually used to store
and replay an entire show or an element of a show from a "go" button.

<strong>Timeline:</strong> This is a timed sequence of playbacks which would usually be used to 
replay a complex cue sequence to a piece of recorded music or a timecoded show.

[Chases](chases.md), [Cue Lists](cue-lists.md) and [Timelines](timelines.md) are 
covered in more detail in the following chapters.

When a Cue, Chase or Cue List is stored on a control, the control is
called a <strong>Playback</strong>. You can store in several places:

-   On any <strong>fader handle</strong> - the fader controls the intensity of
    fixtures (you can make the fader control other things using playback
    [Options](cues/playback-options.md)).
	
-	On a <strong>Virtual fader</strong> in the [Virtual faders](running-the-show/playback-controls.md#virtual-faders) window on the touchscreen. This works exactly like
	a physical fader.

-   On a <strong>touch button</strong> in the Playbacks window - you can set whether
    the button latches or flashes the cue using [Key Profiles](system-settings/key-profiles.md)

-   On a <strong>Macro/Executor button</strong> - again you can use [Key Profiles](system-settings/key-profiles.md) to
    set latch or flash

If you run out of faders to store playbacks, [fader wings](./about-the-consoles/fader-wings.md) are available
for all consoles to add more faders.

Titan's cue functions are very powerful; the first part of this section
explains the basics of how the console uses cues.
